<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 66: Stormblessings</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Kaladin<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Kholin warcamp prison<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Spears, Talenel, Nalan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Kaladin continues to spiral down in depression until he is suddenly released from prison; on his way out, he discovers that Adolin has insisted on sharing the incarceration; the two seem to reach a mutual understanding; Kaladin is rewarded for his part in the duel by being given a full set of Shards; he in turn gives them to Moash; Adolin reluctantly agrees to this disposal; Kaladin and Adolin, accompanied by Bridge Four, leave the prison to the sound of cheers from the soldiers and other bridgemen; as they prepare to return to the barracks for the celebration, Kaladin returns to help Moash with his Plate; Kaladin asserts his judgement that Alethkar will be better off if Elhokar </em>is<em> assassinated, and Moash is delighted with the whole thing. </em></p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>Kaladin jogged up to the man. “Why?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t seem right, you in here,” Adolin said, eyes forward.</p>
<p>“I ruined your chance to duel Sadeas.”</p>
<p>“I’d be crippled or dead without you,” Adolin said. “So I wouldn’t have had the chance to fight Sadeas anyway.” The prince stopped in the hallway, and looked at Kaladin. “Besides. You saved Renarin.”</p>
<p>“It’s my job,” Kaladin said.</p>
<p>“Then we need to pay you more, bridgeboy,” Adolin said. “Because I don’t know if I’ve ever met another man who would jump, unarmored, into a fight among six Shardbearers.”</p>
<p>Kaladin frowned. “Wait. Are you wearing cologne? In <em>prison</em>?”</p>
<p>“Well, there was no need to be barbaric, just because I was incarcerated.”</p>
<p>“Storms, you’re spoiled,” Kaladin said, smiling.</p>
<p>“I’m refined, you insolent farmer,” Adolin said. Then he grinned. “Besides, I’ll have you know that I had to use <em>cold</em> water for my baths while here.”</p>
<p>“Poor boy.”</p>
<p>“I know.” Adolin hesitated, then held out a hand.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know if that’s the most significant conversation in this chapter—there are a lot of those—but it’s still my favorite. This, right here, is the moment when these two men acknowledge their respect for one another. They’ll still give each other a hard time, but now the sting is gone out of it. This is a wonderful, warm moment in a sea of hard, cold events and decisions.</p>
<p>I needed that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>This chapter is an exercise in whiplash. It picks up with Kaladin continuing his depression death spiral, starting to believe all sorts of things that are totally not true. Then… Click. The door opens, he’s free, and all the depression starts to fall away. (Honestly, I have to wonder if there isn’t something else going on here, but I don’t quite know what to suggest. It just seems a little… much—that a few steps, a window, and a breath of fresh air could make quite that difference. Then again, I’ve never been in prison, and I rather like being alone, so… maybe my reaction isn’t worth much.) Anyway…</p>
<p>The next scene is really like that breath of fresh air, in the context of what has felt like <em>so many pages</em> of gloom. I’m pretty sure I laughed like a hyena over finding out Adolin had imprisoned himself, and Kaladin’s reaction to it. It was such a delightful scene, with Adolin totally owning the high ground over everyone. I could have included several <em>pages</em> in the QOTW—the whole thing, from when the jailer first says “Your Highness” to when Moash picks up the Blade. I’ll toss in a couple of the more significant sections, just because they really need to be pointed out for discussion:</p>
<blockquote><p>… “I’m sorry,” he said. “For ruining the plan.”</p>
<p>“Bah, you didn’t ruin it,” Adolin said. “Elhokar did that. You think he couldn’t have simply ignored your request and proceeded, letting me expand on my challenge to Sadeas? He threw a tantrum instead of taking control of the crowd and pushing forward. Storming man.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Adolin, Elhokar bears the primary responsibility for screwing it up. I think I’d agree, but it does my heart good to see Kaladin acknowledge that he was wrong.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The things you said about Amaram,” Adolin said. “Were they true?”</p>
<p>“Every one.”</p>
<p>Adolin nodded. “I’ve always wondered what that man was hiding.” He continued walking.</p>
<p>“Wait,” Kaladin said, jogging to catch up, “you <em>believe</em> me?”</p>
<p>“My father,” Adolin said, “is the best man I know, perhaps the best man <em>alive</em>. Even he loses his temper, makes bad judgment calls, and has a troubled past. Amaram never seems to do anything wrong. If you listen to the stories about him, it’s like everyone expects him to glow in the dark and piss nectar. That stinks, to me, of someone who works too hard to maintain his reputation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, someone taught the boy to think, because that’s downright insightful—one of the many evidences I have for thinking that Adolin is so much more than the dumb-jock type he likes to pretend to be. He’s way smarter than he admits. The thing that hurts most is that this should have done SO much to restore Kaladin’s faith that something could and would be done, but he doesn’t even think about it.</p>
<p>On that subject, then:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your father says I shouldn’t have tried to duel him.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Adolin said, reaching the door at the end of the hallway. “Dueling is formalized in a way I suspect you just don’t get. A darkeyes can’t challenge a man like Amaram, and you certainly shouldn’t have done it like you did. It embarrassed the king, like spitting on a gift he’d given you.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know how you go about learning that what you don’t know can kill you, when you don’t even know how much there is you don’t know, but Kaladin is finally having to realize that he just doesn’t know everything. For all his big ideas, there really are things about the rest of the world that can’t be understood from the perspective of his own life experience. What he did was incredibly presumptuous, but it never even occurred to him that he didn’t know all the rules.</p>
<p>There’s so much more I’d like to talk about here: Kaladin’s gut-wrenched reaction to the Shards, the echo of his earlier attempt when he assigns them to Moash, the distinctly different reaction of Adolin from the way Amaram had responded, Kaladin’s reasoning to persuade Adolin that it would be a good thing. And more: Teft’s confidence that things would be fine, his leadership in Kaladin’s absence, the curiosity about Amaram and Kaladin’s past.</p>
<p>A couple things I will mention, though. When they finally leave the building and go outside:</p>
<blockquote><p>Adolin moved to join his father, but Dalinar watched Kaladin. What did that look mean? So pensive.</p></blockquote>
<p>If only they had talked right here. Dalinar has given Amaram four days to find that Blade they hid, retrieve it, and then come talk to him about it… and clearly he’s heard nothing from Amaram about that subject at all. From what we learn later, at this point Dalinar has good reason to suspect that Kaladin might be telling the truth, rather than Amaram, but he’s still waiting for Amaram to make a move.</p>
<p>And so. I don’t know if it would have mattered at this point anyway. Kaladin had already made up his mind that Elhokar was a bad king and ought to be got out of the kingdom’s way. IIRC, last time we talked about this subject, I was thinking that Kaladin showed pretty poor judgement, trusting the Shards to a man he knew was part of an attempt to murder the king, but in rereading I realized that he knew <em>exactly</em> what he was doing: he was giving the perfect weapon to a man in the perfect position to commit the murder, and setting him up with the perfect alibi. What Kaladin did here could, I think, justifiably be called treason.</p>
<p>It’s too bad that this particular decision didn’t get thrown away with the rest of the captivity-induced lies he was telling himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>This was Kaladin’s fifteenth day in prison; there are fourteen days left on the countdown. Ba-DUM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h4>
<p>There are two notable spren incidents in this chapter. One is the appearance of a veritable cloud of gloryspren around Moash when he picks up his new Blade:</p>
<blockquote><p>The tall bridgeman walked to the side of the room, reaching out a hand to rest his fingers on the Shardblade. He ran those fingers all the way down to the hilt, then seized it, lifting the Blade in awe. Like most, it was enormous, but Moash held it easily in one hand. The heliodor set into the pommel flashed with a burst of light.</p>
<p>Moash looked to the others of Bridge Four, a sea of wide eyes and speechless mouths. Gloryspren rose around him, a spinning mass of at least two dozen spheres of light.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know there has been a lot of debate about the terminology of these little guys, but I still like the term gloryspren. It makes use of a less-familiar sense of “glory” but one that really works for me. Besides, it sounds better than “wowspren.” I suppose in a way, “exaltationspren” would be slightly easier to comprehend, but it just doesn’t have the right ring to it.</p>
<p>Anyway. The other incident is more the absence of a spren:</p>
<blockquote><p>… “I had a lot of time to think, in there,” Kaladin said.</p>
<p>“I can imagine.”</p>
<p>“The time led me to a few decisions,” Kaladin said as the section of Plate locked into place. “One is that your friends are right.”</p>
<p>Moash turned to him sharply. “So&#8230;”</p>
<p>“So tell them I agree with their plan,” Kaladin said. “I’ll do what they want me to in order to help them&#8230; accomplish their task.”</p>
<p>The room grew strangely still.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know <em>exactly</em> what happened there, but something did, and I think it was the Nahel bond being stretched nearly to the breaking point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ars Mechanica</strong></h4>
<p>This is as good a place as any to point out a detail about the Shardblades. At this point, no one in-story really knows for sure whether or not a darkeyed man will become lighteyed if he bonds a Blade, but one thing happens immediately: he becomes fourth dahn. While it doesn’t sound like much on the surface—fourth dahn, out of ten—as Adolin points out, it ranks you above roughly ninety percent of Alethkar… and I suspect the number is actually higher. If only the king, queen, and the heir apparent are in the first dahn, and the second is made up of the highprinces and (presumably) their wives and heirs, that makes a total of at most 33 people in the top two ranks. The third dahn would be made up of the rest of the highprinces’ children, along with their spouses and children, plus an assortment of other landholders. On a guess, <em>maybe</em> a few hundred people? (I wonder how far you can carry the order-of-magnitude progression before it becomes outrageous…) Anyway that leaves Moash ranked equal to or higher than all but a few hundred people in Alethkar. I find this disturbing—but only because it’s Moash. In general, I suppose it makes in-world sense.</p>
<p>Oh, and just for reference, the Blade itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>… a shimmering silvery Blade. Edged on both sides, a pattern of twisting vines ran up its center.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you suppose it’s another Edgedancer Blade?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>You Have to Break a Lot of Rockbuds</strong></h4>
<p>Rock’s stew sounds… frightening, frankly! (It reminds me of the old Dixie’s BBQ here in Bellevue. The proprietor had a pot of “barbecue sauce” he referred to as The Man and it was literally too hot to eat, which meant that it was a local tradition to take out-of-town business guests there to “meet the Man.” Rumor has it that he never emptied the pot, just kept it simmering, and added more chilies when it started to get low.) This stuff of Rock’s has been simmering for three weeks now; it could be deadly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Talenel, the Soldier, the Herald of War; Nalan, the Judge, the Herald of Justice. I’m honestly not sure why Talenel is used here, other than perhaps the new solidarity of two soldiers or the making of a new Shardbearer. Nalan, on the other hand, I’m reasonably sure is here to “honor” Kaladin’s judgement that the king should be killed for the good of Alethkar and maybe the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Shipping Wars</strong></h4>
<p>Stop it. They’re like brothers now, or maybe cousins. Friends and comrades-in-arms—or they would be if Kaladin weren’t secretly conspiring to assassinate Adolin’s <em>real</em> cousin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Just Sayin’</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“Enough of this!” Rock said as the armorers began to work, his voice filling the room like captive thunder.</p></blockquote>
<p>I love this. “Filling the room like captive thunder.” <em>Love</em> this. It’s so perfect for my mental image of Rock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when we rejoin Dalinar and Navani as they face rumors and lies in the high court. Have a good week, and I’ll see you in the comments!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 65: The One Who Deserves It</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Li’l Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Davar Estate, Jah Keved<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Inverse Pattern, Palah, Vedel</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Shallan marvels at the concept of freely choosing one’s own role; encouraged by the thought, she begins to take action and develops her plan for Balat, Eylita and Malise to get away from the danger and gloom of the Davar estate; as she cares for Malise’s injuries, she reveals her plan for them to escape; Malise is doubtful and bitter.</em></p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“If I go,” Malise whispered, “and Balat with me, who will he hate? Who will he hit? Maybe you, finally? The one who actually deserves it?”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Shallan whispered, then left.</p></blockquote>
<p>This conversation always makes me wonder… Does Malise know anything about the past? Does she know that Shallan, and not her father, killed the previous Lady Davar? If she doesn’t, why does she think Shallan is <em>the one who actually deserves it</em>? Shallan’s “infractions” for the past 15 months or so have been minimal, in order to avoid anyone else being hurt in her name. Does Malise see indications that Lin turns any developing anger at Shallan toward herself and/or Balat? Or does she just think it’s unfair that Shallan apparently never gets in trouble?</p>
<p>I’ll probably never know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>Oddly—or perhaps not—I find the section from Jasnah’s book and Shallan’s response to be the most compelling aspect of this chapter.</p>
<blockquote><p>I say that there is no role for women—there is, instead, a role for each woman, and she must make it for herself. For some, it will be the role of scholar; for others, it will be the role of wife. For others, it will be both. For yet others, it will be neither.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shallan’s reaction strongly demonstrates the differences between their personalities and their backgrounds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Highlady Kholin talked about the nobility of choice, as if every woman had such opportunity. The decision between being a mother or a scholar seemed a difficult decision in Jasnah’s estimation. That wasn’t a difficult choice at all! That seemed like a grand place to be! Either would be delightful when compared to a life of fear in a house seething with anger, depression, and hopelessness.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not to diminish Jasnah’s work to free herself from the tyranny of Expectations, but it makes me itch just a little to smack her upside the head and remind her that she’s had it pretty easy, all in all. And of course, the same question comes in other flavors: not merely whether a <em>woman</em> should have the freedom to choose her place, but a darkeyed farmboy, or a lighteyed artist, or… you could supply plenty of other examples, amiright? For that matter, a highprince’s sons are pretty restricted, too.</p>
<p>The thing is, as nice as Jasnah’s ideology sounds, there are things I don’t think she understands. Or she doesn’t accept them, maybe. People don’t function that way very well, and societies even less so. One reason, I suppose, is that people as a whole are too ready to believe that they have no power to choose. More importantly, though, many people actively and deliberately accept the responsibilities they were born into, and however unhappy they might be in their work, they stay because other people—family—depend on them. (Jasnah doesn’t actually have that kind of experience…) Still and all, people tend to like to know where they’re supposed to fit. Then if they’re unhappy, they can blame it on whatever superficial factors keep them there, without having to actually make the choice and the related sacrifices to do something they claim they would rather do.</p>
<p>One philosopher I know has said that we always choose what we most want, and on the whole I believe he’s right. Many a morning I thought what I most wanted was to stay in bed, certainly <em>way</em> more than I wanted to get up, put my face on, and get dressed… but it turned out that I wanted a paycheck more than I wanted the extra sleep. I chose the thing I wanted most overall, not merely for the moment; I think the same can be said of all choices we make. Unfortunately for Jasnah’s philosophy, what people mostly want is to be accepted and approved by society, or their chosen subgroup of society.</p>
<p>And… I’m about to stray into social criticism, so we’ll head that off now.</p>
<p>There are, however, things that we could all learn from her ideals:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do not mistake me in assuming I value one woman’s role above another. My point is not to stratify our society—we have done that far too well already—my point is to diversify our discourse.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an area where I think our modern society fails miserably. And… I have so much to say about it, that I’m not going to say anything at all. Just that we need to stop with the idea that someone is “wasting his/her life” by making a choice that doesn’t appeal to our own priorities.</p>
<p>Moving on with the story… It strikes me again that Shallan doesn’t realize what is behind her father’s “self-control” toward her. She honestly thinks it’s because he loves her so much that he restrains himself for her sake—a Moral Event Horizon of sorts, perhaps. While I do think that was his original position, it doesn’t appear to have ever crossed Shallan’s mind that her father is afraid of her. He knows, if she doesn’t, that if he threatens her to the point of injury or death, she could pull a Shardblade on him. Deep down, of course, she knows she could do that—but she’s never made the connection from her Blade to her father’s fear-instilled self-restraint.</p>
<p>Speaking of her father, this rather gives me the shivers:</p>
<p>He looked up as she walked back into the feast hall. She set the cup before him, looking into his eyes. No darkness there today. Just him. That was very rare, these days.</p>
<p>Even with “no darkness, just him,” he’s pretty scary by now. He’s been twisted and wrung out so hard. I still feel sorry for him, but he’s gotten bad. Right here, he’s trying hard to rationalize what he’s doing when the darkness <em>is </em>there, but the fact that he’s trying to justify his earlier actions is… creepy. “No one will listen. The litter was all runts anyway.” It’s all someone else’s fault. Pretty sure he knows it’s not, though, or he wouldn’t have to try so hard.</p>
<p>Poor Balat. This was just too much. He’s back to… well, not quite to where he <em>was</em>, reveling in the violence of the axehound fights, but back to petty cruelties against small critters. He doesn’t have the backbone to stand up to his father, and he doesn’t have the skill to do it even if he did have the spine. All he can do is shiver, tear apart cremlings, and hope his little sister can figure it out for him. He’s not someone I can like, but I do feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>Then there’s Malise. At this point, I feel sorrier for her than anyone. She’s been in this family for two and a half years now, and she’s done her level best to make it work. She’s tried to be a decent mother and wife, in a very strange situation. Now she’s got a broken arm and assorted minor injuries, her husband apparently hates everyone but his young daughter, and her only hope is for that daughter to create a way for her to escape.</p>
<p>What a broken, irrational household.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>This is the same day as the previous flashback in Chapter 61, and takes place just a few hours later. For the record, Shallan has recently turned sixteen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Spren-Spotting</strong></h4>
<p>Okay, we don’t actually see Pattern in this chapter, but Shallan “sees” his light blazing from behind the painting which covers Father’s strongbox. It’s a pretty potent visual: she finds it <em>blindingly</em> bright—and yet she still can’t get past “not since… not since…” when she thinks of how long it’s been since she entered this room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Palah, I believe, represents Jasnah’s scholarship as displayed at the beginning of the chapter. Quite possibly, also, she reflects the “learning” Shallan does in this chapter (and will further in a year or so), as well as the “giving” aspect of Shallan’s planning for Balat and Malise to escape, knowing she will remain in this “house seething with anger, depression, and hopelessness” when they leave. Vedel usually represents healing, which is appropriate to Shallan’s ministrations to Malise; she also denotes loving—which, again, fits the planning for everyone else to escape even though she can’t. Or won’t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sigh. Now I’m gloomy too. Maybe rejoining Kaladin in prison will cheer me up.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, next week does get better, because Kaladin’s imprisonment is over! Yay!! Come back next week and we’ll have a happy dance party and smile again!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 64: Treasures</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Kaladin, Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Kholin warcamp: prison &amp; monastery<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Pattern, Ishar, Shalash</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Kaladin is giving in to depression, as he finds himself slipping into the mode of not eating, not caring, not thinking; desperate, he reaches for Stormlight, praying to not go back into the darkness; the Light resists, but finally comes to him; Sylphrena is worried that he’s becoming darker; he says it’s only the cage; she begins to argue, but then goes off to giggle at a little cremling, while Kaladin thinks how childlike she is. Meanwhile Shallan, trying not to panic as Amaram approaches Talenel’s cell, wraps herself in Stormlight, turns herself black, and hides in the darkest corner; as always, she’s angry at the sight of him, but reason tempers her anger; Amaram speaks to Taln, who merely continues his repetiti0ns; Bordin reiterates his earlier report of a cache of Shardblades, which Amaram assumes to be the Honorblades; he tries to get Taln to speak of them again, but his litany remains the same; Bordin acts nervous, and Amaram finally agrees to leave, to seek out this treasure of Blades; Shallan finally breathes, feeling that she is very much out of her depth, but replaces her Veil illusion and returns to Iyatil; as she prepares to leave, she slips Iyatil the paper transcribing Taln’s ramblings and promises a full report later; Iyatil questions who she really is, but Shallan, though thrilled by the respect shown her, says only that she seeks the truth; later, having sent the promised report, she receives a message from Mraize, informing her of her change of status and welcoming her to the Ghostbloods.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>Shallan breathed out a long, deep breath, slumping down to the floor. “It’s like that sea of spheres.”</p>
<p>“Shallan?” Pattern asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve fallen in,” she said, “and it isn’t that the water is over my head— it’s that the stuff isn’t even water, and I have no idea how to swim in it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That is an excellent simile. Oh, what a feeling…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>First, a quick housekeeping note. Since next Thursday is Christmas Eve, there will be no post that day. The following Thursday is New Year’s Eve, but since the post goes up early and the partying won’t start until later (theoretically), I’m shooting to reread Chapter 65 on December 31<sup>st</sup>. Send the old year out with a bang, finish strong, all that good stuff.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366">UPDATE: No post on New Year&#8217;s Eve. I&#8217;m sorry, but it&#8217;s just not going to happen.</span></p>
<p>To the Reread!! Onward, ho! We start off the chapter in an incredibly cheerful mood, as Kaladin ignores his food and thinks about how much he loves being caged, how this is just as much fun as his slave days, and compares it to adventures in mountain-climbing.</p>
<p>Oh, wait. Never mind. Reset.</p>
<p>Yeah… So here’s Kaladin, demonstrating classic signs of depression: lack of appetite, lack of energy, lack of interest. Combined with the recent discussion of whether Kaladin has an over-inflated estimate of his own importance, I’m now beginning to wonder if he’s bipolar; a list of symptoms for the “manic” aspect of bipolar disorder includes “feeling extremely irritable, aggressive, and “wired”; thinking of yourself as overly important, gifted, or special; making poor judgments, such as with money, relationships, or gambling; engaging in risky behavior or taking more risks than you ordinarily would.” That… sounds pretty much like Kaladin during/after the duel. Well, I don’t recall hearing Brandon mention anything beyond seasonal depression, so he’s probably not intentionally written that way. It was just hard to miss the coincidence.</p>
<p>This short scene with Kaladin leaves me with very mixed feelings, though. One, depression is just not fun. At all. No matter what the cause. Two, his desperate reaching for Stormlight, praying to the Almighty that the darkness would not take him again, hoping that his prayer will be heard despite the lack of someone to write and burn the prayer for him—all this makes me so sad for him. Three, I’m creeped out a little by the way the Stormlight resists him, and then gives in. Four, I’m even more weirded out by the way he thinks of it straining against him, trying to escape once he’s got it. Five, his attitude toward Syl is just bizarre, and her behavior reflects that. And he doesn’t even notice that there’s anything wrong with her behavior. I come out of this scene sad and extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Shallan, despite her own desperate situation, is actually a breath of fresh air after that. How much is quick thinking, and how much just a lucky instinct, I don’t know—but she immediately does the only thing likely to work. This just makes me smile: turn everything about yourself black and stand quietly in the darkest corner. No one expects you to be there, so no one notices you. Slick.</p>
<p>In what I’m coming to see as typical Shallan fashion, reason again informs—or at least tempers—emotion: though Amaram is “still a bastard, of course” (which he is!) she recognizes that he was probably just defending himself when “he” killed Helaran. Apparently there is a certain amount of mostly-true information readily available regarding the event; she’s put together enough information to know that when Helaran left Jah Keved—and left his siblings to their father’s mercies—it was to kill Amaram.</p>
<p>Other quick notes on the Talenel scene:</p>
<p>Amaram is immediately convinced that this is indeed one of the Heralds, and his reaction is to say, “Gavilar, we have done it. We have finally <em>done it.</em>” “It” is presumably their goal of bringing the Heralds back, and I have to wonder just what they did to try to reach their goal. I’m almost certain that nothing they did had anything to do with Taln’s return, though Amaram clearly thinks it did. I rather hope we get to see his reaction when he learns that whatever they did was a complete waste, and Taln has only returned because he finally broke under four and a half millennia of torture.</p>
<p>Bordin has planted the rumor about a cache of Shardblades, making sure it went straight to Amaram’s ears. Amaram, for reasons only he knows, leaps to the conclusion that they must be the Honorblades. I wonder if any of them <em>are</em> Honorblades. I have other questions, too: Was there actually more than one Blade in the stash Dalinar planted there? If so, where did they come from? If not, why was Amaram not more perturbed about there only being one, when there were supposed to be a cache? Was one of them the Blade Taln arrived with at the end of <em>TWoK</em>? Or did Taln actually talk about a cache of Blades? So much we don’t know.</p>
<p>Amaram promises Bordin a “reward” for helping him find this cache of supposed Honorblades. Heh. Clearly he doesn’t understand Bordin, or for that matter anything about the loyalty of Team Kholin, at all…</p>
<p>And then Shallan becomes a full-fledged Ghostblood, except that somehow she never gets around to getting that tattoo done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>This is the same day as Chapter 63, one day after Kaladin’s last chapter; it is his 11<sup>th</sup> day in prison, counting the day of the duel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h4>
<p>It’s rather agonizing to watch Syl regress—and it’s really, really annoying that Kaladin doesn’t even register the change.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m worried about you.” Syl’s voice. “You’re growing dark.”</p>
<p>Kaladin opened his eyes and finally found her, sitting between two of the bars as if on a swing.</p>
<p>“I’ll be all right,” Kaladin said, letting Stormlight rise from his lips like smoke. “I just need to get out of this cage.”</p>
<p>“It’s worse than that. It’s the darkness &#8230; the darkness &#8230;” She looked to the side, then giggled suddenly, streaking off to inspect something on the floor. A little cremling that was creeping along the edge of the room. She stood over it, eyes widening at the stark red and violet color of its shell.</p>
<p>Kaladin smiled. She was still a spren. Childlike. The world was a place of wonder to Syl. What would that be like?</p></blockquote>
<p>Patronizing git.</p>
<p>I want to get angry and smack Kaladin around a bit… but at the same time, I understand all too well the depression, and the way it can twist your perceptions. It seems to me, though, that the difference between Syl two weeks ago and Syl now <em>should</em> be totally obvious; he’s just too self-absorbed to realize it. (And yes, self-absorption <em>is</em> a notable aspect of depression, so don’t tell me I’m being insensitive.)</p>
<p>I’m wondering, now, though: how much does he realize about his effect on her? IIRC, by now they’ve had enough conversations that he knows her increasing “maturity”—or understanding, anyway—is an artifact of their bond. But does he have any real concept that his mindset can affect that bond, and through it affect her mental state? (Does it even make sense to talk about the mental state of a cognitive phenomenon? Heh.)</p>
<p>Also: is “the darkness… the darkness…” referring to the mental/emotional darkness of his depression, or is there something else here, too?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>All Creatures Shelled and Feathered</strong></h4>
<p>Speaking of Syl and the cremling, is there anything unusual about a little cremling with a shell colored “stark red and violet”?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ars Arcanum</strong></h4>
<p>It’s interesting to note that when Kaladin attempts to draw in Stormlight from the lamp, it seems to resist him. I assume that’s a result of the damage his drive for revenge is doing to his bond with Syl… but then why does it suddenly relent? And his reaction… it’s like an addict getting a fix. It’s creepy.</p>
<p>Shallan’s Surgebinding, on the other hand, is totally useful and not at all creepy—unless you think that turning her skin, hair, and clothing all <em>black</em> might have just a little creep factor. Still, it’s useful; she can stand silently in a dark corner and not be seen, plus the Illusion uses up the Stormlight that would normally escape and give her away.</p>
<p>It’s also worth pointing out that she uses Illusion twice in this chapter—to turn black, and to turn back into Veil—and neither time does Taln react like he did previously, when he scared the living daylights out of her. Just guessing, but I suppose that having identified her as “one of Ishar’s Knights,” he has a niche for her, and her Surgebinding is an accepted part of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Haven’t We Met Somewhere Before?</strong></h4>
<p>There’s not a lot new to say about Iyatil-and-Mraize-the-Worldhoppers, but it’s interesting to note her comments on her own and Mraize’s past experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You caught me in stealth spying upon you, and you can lose me in the streets. This is not easily accomplished. Your clever drawings fascinate Mraize, another near-impossible task, considering all that he has seen. Now what you have done today.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s also interesting to note Shallan’s response:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shallan felt a thrill. Why should she feel so excited to have the respect of these people? They were murderers.</p>
<p>But storms take her, she had <em>earned</em> that respect.</p></blockquote>
<p>As always, contemplation of the Ghostbloods brings me back around to wondering what their real purpose is and where they originate. Why would they have been working through a relatively obscure rural Veden lord, and what were they going to use him to accomplish? Why were they trying to kill Jasnah? <em>Who are these people?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Ishar and Shalash stand watch over this chapter, for reasons best known to Team Dragonsteel… but my best guess is that Ishar the Priest, pious and guiding, reflects Kaladin’s desperate prayer against the darkness. Shalash is probably there for her little Lightweaver Shallan, with her several uses of Illusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Just Sayin’</strong></h4>
<p>“Almighty above, ten names, all true.” Well, that sounds pretty emphatic…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again, there will be no post next week on Christmas Eve. We’ll be back on the last day of the year with another uneasy visit to the Davar estate, and then we can start the new year on a brighter note.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366">UPDATE: Scratch that, we&#8217;ll visit the Davar estate on January 7. Enjoy some goodies, anyway. By the time I&#8217;m done, the Storm Cellar should be well-stocked with Irish cream fudge, peanut brittle, gingerbread, and cookies&#8230;</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 63: A Burning World</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Sebarial &amp; Kholin warcamps<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Pattern, Shalash, Talenel</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Shallan converses via spanreed with Adolin, who is mysteriously occupied; at the same time, she is attempting to spy on the Ghostbloods who are attempting to spy on her; she finally figures it out and sends Pattern to find the spy; he then carries a Veil illusion and draws the spy out of her hiding place; getting the drop on said spy, Shallan-as-Veil initiates a conversation, resulting in the two proceeding together on the mission rather than Iyatil sneaking along spying on Veil; a little sleight-of-Illusion gets them into Dalinar’s warcamp without Iyatil seeing the means Shallan uses; once they enter the temple grounds, Shallan gets them into the monastery building by claiming that Iyatil is her sister and is doing seriously weird things with this mask gig; Iyatil reluctantly plays along, keeping the ardents occupied while Shallan seeks out her quarry—the man who calls himself Talanel-Elin; he recites his muttered litany about Desolations and loss, bronze and steel, preparations and training; Shallan writes it all down and double-checks it, since he says the same thing every time; when she draws in Stormlight to replace her disguise, however, he comes unglued and grabs her; he seems to recognize her as a Knight Radiant, though he can’t quite put all the pieces together, but then gives up and settles back into his repetitions; as she again attempts to slip out the door, she sees a group coming right to this same cell, and one of them is Amaram.</em></p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“My name,” the woman said. “Iyatil.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard one like it.”</p>
<p>“Unsurprising. Your task today was to investigate a certain new arrival into Dalinar’s camp. We wish to know about this person, and Dalinar’s allegiances are uncertain.”</p>
<p>“He’s loyal to the king and the Throne.”</p>
<p>“Outwardly,” the woman said. “His brother knew things of an extraordinary nature. We are uncertain if Dalinar was told of these things or not, and his interactions with Amaram worry us. This newcomer is linked.”</p>
<p>“Amaram is making maps of the Shattered Plains,” Shallan said. “Why? What is out there that he wants?” <em>And why would he want to return the Voidbringers?</em></p>
<p>Iyatil didn’t answer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Somehow I don’t think Iyatil cares about Dalinar’s allegiance to king and throne; she’s obviously more concerned about his possible involvement with one of the “secret society” organizations we’ve been glimpsing. Which makes me wonder… was Gavilar actively committed to the goals of only one group, or was he linked to several of them? These shadowy groups make my head hurt; there are too many of them, with overlapping and contradictory goals. And I don’t know quite enough about any of them… which is a little odd, considering how much more we learned about them in this book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>The plot thickens… The Ghostbloods, whoever they are, are now very interested in Dalinar’s “madman”—mostly because of Dalinar’s connections to Gavilar and Amaram. I find it mildly amusing that neither the Ghostbloods nor Dalinar know/believe who the guy is—but his (assumed) identity is far more critical to current events than they seem to realize. The “Sons of Honor,” on the other hand, believe he is who he claims to be, and take it as a sign that their purpose will be fulfilled—but they don’t seem to realize what horrible things may have been unleashed. But… that’s probably a discussion for another time.</p>
<p>There’s a lovely little worldbuilding sidelight slipped in here, as Shallan and Iyatil approach Dalinar’s temple. Apparently, along with prayer and counseling, the ardents provide both trade school and liberal arts education. (I’m using “liberal arts” in the original sense—the arts worthy of a free person, to enable him or her to take an active part in civic life.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Darkeyes from almost any nahn could come to be taught a trade, exercising their divine Right to Learn, as mandated by the Heralds. Lesser lighteyes came to learn trades as well, and the higher dahns came to learn the arts or progress in their Callings to please the Almighty.</p>
<p>A large population of ardents like this one would have true masters in every art and trade. Perhaps she should come and seek Dalinar’s artists for training.</p></blockquote>
<p>So (almost*) any person in Alethkar could go to the ardents to learn any trade appropriate to their means and skills, and those of sufficient rank or wealth to not need a trade could still come to be educated in the arts. Visual arts, music, logic, rhetoric, philosophy, astronomy, mathematics—it would have been available in the level and form suitable to the individual’s skills and inclinations. Despite our earlier conversations about Adolin’s lack of education, I’m suspicious that he’s not necessarily so lacking as we thought—or any absence is more attributable to lack of interest than lack of opportunity.</p>
<p>*almost any person… I assume this excludes those which the Copperminds identifies thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>While those at the lowest level of nahn without the right of travel are essentially serfs tied to the land they are currently on, this is relatively rare. Many more people are at the slightly higher levels of nahn that include the right of travel.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there are a few whose right of travel is so restricted that they would not be able to seek out the ardentia for training, but it’s not all that common. WoB is that “To be lower ranked than that, something has to have gone wrong for your ancestors and that sort of thing.” I hadn’t really noted this particular tidbit before, but thanks to some of our discussions, I found it very interesting now.</p>
<p>Last but not least is Shallan’s brief interaction with Talenel’Elin. Most of it is the same old stuff he’s repeated every time we’ve seen him, with two exceptions: Early on, she whispers, “Who are you?” and he gives his name and cognomen. Later, as she prepares to resume her ardent disguise, <em>something</em> about it gets his undivided attention—to the point where she summons her Blade—but after a few mutters about “Ishar’s Knights” he gives up and goes back to his bed. Something I just now noticed, though:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shallan inched forward, and found he was back to whispering the same things as before. She dismissed the Blade.</p>
<p><em>Mother’s soul … </em></p>
<p>“Shallan?” Pattern asked. “Shallan, are you mad?”</p>
<p>She shook herself. How much time had passed?</p></blockquote>
<p><em>She just blanked out again, didn’t she?</em> Why did I never see that before? So then the question is: did Pattern ask if she was mad because she summoned her Blade, or because she went blank after she dismissed him? And did he use “mad” in the sense of “angry” or “broken in the head”?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>This is the day after Dalinar’s visit to Kaladin; there are 18 days left in the countdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>All Creatures Shelled and Feathered</strong></h4>
<p>The gnarly tree needs to be mentioned here. Shallan thinks of it as sort of a cross between a dendrolith (literally, treestone) and a dalewillow (valley willow?). In any case, it’s a clever place to hide something when you want to be sure you see who picks it up; they either have to approach slowly, which is rather obvious, or the tree will pull in its fronds, which is also rather obvious. (Of course, if you really don’t want anyone to see what you’re using it for, maybe it’s not such a good choice. Either way you approach, it’s obvious. I don’t think the Ghostbloods really care about that aspect, though; they just want to be sure they see her pick up the instructions, so they can follow her.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ars Arcanum</strong></h4>
<p>Pattern and Shallan really get their Lightweaving on, this time. It’s fun to watch as they put to use the things they were discovering last time we saw them. They’ve now moved from simply attaching a picture to Pattern, to a sequence of movement allowing him to “walk” the Illusion where others will see it and not be suspicious.</p>
<p>First, though, there was the neat trick with her hideout; arriving in the dark to create an extension of the shed on top of the building—and this time, with a missing brick or two so she can see out. Clever girl. Points, also, for realizing that they were watching for her; fortunately, they don’t know that she has several ways of getting around their precautions. Sending Pattern to find the spy was genius—and a very Shallan thing to do.</p>
<p>She’s getting quite deft at disguises, our girl. Two versions of Veil, a quick switch from Veil to Shallan and back to Veil, the ardent in the monastery, and Veil again. She must have had a whole sleeve-full of infused spheres to fuel all that! This is where I start thinking, “Don’t get cocky, now, there are still dangers! And don’t forget who you’re supposed to be for each scene!”</p>
<blockquote><p>Shallan took a deep breath and pulled on her hat, breathing out a second image, one that covered her over and transformed her into Veil. The one on Pattern would remain so long as he had Stormlight. That Stormlight drained from him a lot faster than it did from Shallan, though. She didn’t know why.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do we know why the Stormlight drains from Pattern so much faster than from Shallan? I think I should know, but tonight I’m drawing a blank. Help me out here, friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Haven’t We Met Somewhere Before?</strong></h4>
<p>Oh, Iyatil. Shall we start a betting pool on what world she’s from?</p>
<p>She’s obviously baffled and intrigued by Shallan’s—or should I say Veil’s—methods; “I sent a double” can cover Pattern-Veil’s trip to the cache, but getting into the Kholin warcamp isn’t so easily explained. (Shallan is wise not to try, and lucky that her persona would be disinclined to share such secrets.) So here’s my big question: if Iyatil found out what Shallan was doing, would she be more interested in the Lightweaving itself, or in how to use it to accomplish her goals here on Roshar?</p>
<p>We know she’s a world-hopper; what we don’t know is why she’s here, why she’s teaching Mraize, whether she’s part of one of the inter-world organizations we (sort of) know about, which one, and what their ultimate goals are.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Why the mask?” Shallan asked, leaning forward. “What does it mean? Why do you hide?”</p>
<p>“I have many times asked myself,” Iyatil said, “why those of you here go about so brazenly with features exposed to all who would see them. My mask reserves my self. Besides, it gives me the ability to adapt.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm…</p>
<p>It disturbs me to know that it will be many, many years before Brandon gets enough of the Cosmere story out there to answer this kind of question. I’m not getting any younger, here, you know! Well, some answers will come sooner than others, I suppose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Shalash and Talenel are here for fairly obvious reasons: Shalash, for her Lightweaver-in-training and all the clever Illusions being wrought; and Talenel for, well, himself. I know Brandon’s been a bit cagey about whether or not this person really is Taln, but I’m going to assume that he is, at least until I see textual evidence that he isn’t. It’s just easier that way.</p>
<p>I’m guessing that the title “A Burning World” is something to do with the reality that Taln has known for the last 4500 years? That, or what he expects to be happening on Roshar in the near future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Shipping Wars</strong></h4>
<p>Awww, they’re texting!! Isn’t that sweet? Although Shallan is just a little too good at lying to her betrothed, she could hardly tell him what she’s really doing at this point. Still, they’re awfully cute. The whole thing made me grin—especially the part where he has to have an ardent to do the reading and writing for him, and teases the ardent in the process.</p>
<p>She’s clearly new to the courting game (well, we know she is! duh!); she’s bemused that Adolin seems so surprised at her lack of jealousy. I find it amusing that his reputation is largely what makes the women he’s courted so wary of any attention he pays anyone else—but at the same time, their jealousy is also part of what destroys any real relationship that could have otherwise developed. Frankly, this is one of the reasons I love the Shallan-Adolin ship—she’s a perfect, refreshing change from everything he’s known before. She’s willing to actually trust him.</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps she should cling more firmly, but the thought of it nauseated her. Such behavior reminded her of Father, holding so tightly to everything that he eventually broke it all.</p>
<p>… No, Father’s way was not right. If she wanted to keep Adolin, she had to try something far more difficult than just clinging to him. She’d have to be so irresistible that he didn’t want to let go.</p></blockquote>
<p>Way to go, girl! (It does remind me of “She’d have to rely, instead, upon her feminine wiles. She wished she knew if she had any.” Poor girl.)</p>
<p>Incidentally, a couple of small bombshells are slipped in here, ready to explode downstream. Adolin is bored; he can’t leave his current location, but he <em>could</em> have a visitor. Heh. I <em>wonder</em> where he is! Also, Dalinar is feeling much better now, thank you… Just a head cold or something, you know? Nothing to worry about, all back to normal. Ya, shurr, you betcha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when Kaladin continues to be frustrated in prison, while Shallan resolves this chapter’s cliffhanger.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 62: The One Who Killed Promises</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Kaladin<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Kholin warcamp prison<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Spears, Nalan</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Kaladin grumbles at the sameness of the days in prison; Syl has been hiding from him; she speaks of seeing a Cryptic at the fight, and that she recognizes signs that they are looking for someone to bond; Dalinar enters the room, and Kaladin salutes despite himself; Dalinar assures him that he’ll be out in a few more days, but Kaladin expresses doubt, given Elhokar’s history; Dalinar knows immediately that he’s speaking of the silversmiths in Kholinar, and mentions the Roshone affair; Kaladin asks for further information, and Dalinar gives him a brief version; Kaladin phrases his response in terms that fail to allow Dalinar to understand the personal impact Roshone’s exile had on him; Dalinar reminds Kaladin that, however things </em>should<em> work, the way they </em>do<em> work means that challenging Amaram was an ineffective approach to changing them; Dalinar leaves, and Kaladin focuses only on the fact that Elhokar’s poor decision-making inadvertently cost his family their comfortable position in Hearthstone, and decides that it would be best for the kingdom if Elhokar were removed. </em></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“I gave you a position no darkeyes has ever held in this army. I let you into conferences with the king, and I listened when you spoke. Do <em>not</em> make me regret those decisions, soldier.”</p>
<p>“You don’t already?” Kaladin asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve come close,” Dalinar said. “I understand, though. If you truly believe what you told me about Amaram &#8230; well, if I’d been in your place, I’d have been hard pressed not to do the same thing you did. But storm it, man, you’re still a <em>darkeyes</em>.”</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t matter.”</p>
<p>“Maybe it shouldn’t, but it <em>does</em>. You want to change that? Well, you’re not going to do it by screaming like a lunatic and challenging men like Amaram to duels. You’ll do it by distinguishing yourself in the position I gave you. Be the kind of man that others admire, whether they be lighteyed or dark. Convince Elhokar that a darkeyes can lead. <em>That</em> will change the world.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm. I’d forgotten that Dalinar says this so clearly. “Maybe it shouldn’t, but it <em>does.</em>” This is what I keep trying to say: when things don’t work the way they should, by all means you should work to change them – but <em>ignoring</em> the way they work won’t change anything… except changing your status from “free” to “in prison.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>This is really the meat of the chapter, as Dalinar unwittingly fills in the final arc that brings Kaladin’s and Moash’s backstories into a loop.</p>
<p>“The Roshone affair.” I’m reminded of Chapter 37 in <em>The Way of Kings</em>, when Lirin said, “I still don’t know which highlord was behind sending him here to torment us, though I wish I had him for a few moments in a dark room….” Now Kaladin knows, and I suppose with the backdrop of Lirin’s anger at whatever highlord inflicted Roshone on them, it’s no wonder he holds Elhokar partially to blame for what his family suffered from Roshone’s malice.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was it a good thing for Kaladin to bring up Elhokar’s past errors? Is his own situation (keeping Dalinar in mind, here) sufficient justification for more or less accusing Elhokar of intending to leave him to die in prison?</li>
<li>Should he have told Dalinar about his own Roshone connection? Would Dalinar have done anything differently? Would telling the story have changed Kaladin’s perspective? Would it have made any difference in Kaladin’s decision to support Moash’s assassination plans?</li>
<li>Is this an overuse of the lack-of-communication plot device, or is it a justified use, or is the device irrelevant to the situation? (I.e., lack of communication isn’t really the problem here.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I, of course, have my own opinions on these things, but I’d really like to hear your discussions.</p>
<p>I know I’ve mentioned this before, but I think it’s worth pointing out now that we’re here. Dalinar’s reaction to Kaladin’s claim that Elhokar “has a history of letting inconvenient people rot in dungeons until they die” should reveal something to Kaladin and to us. <em>That was an isolated incident.</em> While Elhokar does indeed have a real history of taking advice from the wrong people and making truly atrocious leadership decisions, this is not one he repeated.  Dalinar instantly knew exactly who Kaladin was talking about: the silversmiths back in Kholinar&#8230; meaning it only happened that one time.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that he didn’t have other people unjustly imprisoned, or that he didn’t thoughtlessly make a mess of many lives by doing favors for those who flattered him enough. I’m just saying that clearly someone learned something from that debacle, and either Elhokar was smart enough not to repeat it, or Dalinar (and/or Gavilar) was smart enough to keep a better eye on the crown prince.</p>
<p>Kaladin, of course, only sees that Elhokar’s past foolishness ended with his own family’s maltreatment by Roshone, and connects it with the tantrum Elhokar threw after the big fight and his own imprisonment. As a result – despite Dalinar’s wise words about loyalty and generosity and the flaws of all men – Kaladin decides he’s qualified to determine the course that will be best for the welfare of the kingdom and Dalinar himself.</p>
<p>Just a bit arrogant, m’lad. Just a bit.</p>
<p>Also: if Dalinar’s “I was … away at the time” is referring to his trip to the Nightwatcher, said trip had nothing to do with Gavilar’s death. (I seem to recall recent speculation along that line, right?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stormwatch:</strong> This is Kaladin’s tenth day in prison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sprenspotting:</strong> Kaladin sees captivity-spren! Pretty sure that’s what they are, “strange spren like taut wires crossing before him.” I have a theory that Axies never saw them because being imprisoned just never bothered him enough. Could have something to do with the length of the imprisonment, though, I suppose.</p>
<p>In other news, Syl has become very hard to spot – which I assume is largely a matter of her discomfort with Kaladin’s current attitude and the distance he&#8217;s put between them. However, she’s still talking to him.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There was a Cryptic at the fight,” her voice said softly.</p>
<p>“You mentioned those before, didn’t you? A type of spren?”</p>
<p>“A revolting type.” She paused. “But not evil, I don’t think.” She sounded begrudging. “I was going to follow it, as it fled, but you needed me. When I went back to look, it had hidden from me.”</p>
<p>“What does it mean?” Kaladin asked, frowning.</p>
<p>“Cryptics like to plan,” Syl said slowly, as if recalling something long lost. “Yes &#8230; I remember. They debate and watch and never do anything. But &#8230;”</p>
<p>“What?” Kaladin asked, rising.</p>
<p>“They’re looking for someone,” Syl said. “I’ve seen the signs. Soon, you might not be alone, Kaladin.”</p>
<p>Looking for someone. To choose, like him, as a Surgebinder. What kind of Knight Radiant had been made by a group of spren Syl so obviously detested? It didn’t seem like someone he’d want to get to know.</p>
<p><em>Oh, storms,</em> Kaladin thought, sitting back down. <em>If they choose Adolin</em> &#8230;</p>
<p>The thought should have made him sick. Instead, he found Syl’s revelation oddly comforting. Not being alone, even if it did turn out to be Adolin, made him feel better and drove away some small measure of his gloom.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m… just going to leave that there for you to discuss. I can’t seem to phrase my comments coherently, but this conversation seems Significant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>All Creatures Shelled and Feathered</strong></h4>
<p>No, this has neither shell nor feather, and in fact isn’t in this chapter at all. I include it anyway, and my reasons are twofold: One, I miss Carl around here. Two, this chapter could seriously use some levity. Or levitation. Either one.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cat-for-Carl.jpg?fit=0%2C%209999&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100"><img class="size-full wp-image-198363 aligncenter" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cat-for-Carl.jpg?fit=497%2C%209999&#038;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C494px" alt="Cat for Carl" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Also: Snuhr. I want some this year!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Heraldic Symbolism:</strong> Nalan. I would venture to guess that his presence reflects Kaladin’s conclusion that “justice” requires getting rid of the king, presuming to know what’s best for the kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us depressed until next week, when Shallan gets all clever and outwits a Ghostblood or something. See you in the comments!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 61: Obedience</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Li’l Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Davar estate<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Inverse Pattern, Chach, Nalan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Shallan has become the perfect, quiet, obedient daughter; the Davar fortunes are slowly changing, but Father is not happier as a result; he forbids Balat’s courtship of Eylita; in retribution for defiance, Father has Balat’s new pod of axehound pups slaughtered; Father has not only a new steward, but a whole new batch of frightening guards; Helaran has returned to the area briefly, but will soon be gone for a long time (!); Balat suggests that he, Eylita, and Shallan run away and find work in Vedenar; Shallan thinks that perhaps Balat should leave, but she herself must stay; Lord Davar orders one of his men to find and kill Helaran, promising the Shardblade as his reward; Malise confronts him, and a shouting match ensues; Lord Davar stomps out, complaining that it’s all everyone else’s fault because no one in this house obeys him.</em></p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“Would you go with me? If I took Eylita and left? You could be a scribe. Earn your own way, be free of Father.”</p>
<p>“I &#8230; No. I need to stay.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Something has hold of Father, something awful. If we all leave, we give him to it. Someone has to help him.”</p>
<p>“Why do you defend him so? You know what he did.”</p>
<p>“He didn’t do it.”</p>
<p>“You can’t remember,” Balat said. “You’ve told me over and over that your mind blanks. You saw him kill her, but you don’t want to admit that you witnessed it. Storms, Shallan. You’re as broken as Wikim and Jushu. As &#8230; as I am sometimes &#8230;”</p></blockquote>
<p>While I do understand and sympathize with the need for Li’l Shallan to block her memories, I can’t help thinking that life would have been a lot better for the rest of the family if they’d known the truth. The brothers wouldn’t have to hate their father; their father wouldn’t have to bear Shallan’s secret alone; they could all work together to protect Shallan from the other crazies out there; the internal pressure wouldn’t have to drive them all into their own special form of insanity. *sigh*</p>
<p>But then there wouldn’t be much of a story, so there’s that, I guess. All right, I don’t <em>really</em> want to care less about the characters in a book, or I wouldn’t love the book so much. Even so.</p>
<p><em>SANDERSOOOOONNNNNN! You make my heart hurt!</em></p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>And so we return to the depressive atmosphere of the Davar estate. Last time we were here, Lord Davar had refused to pay Jushu’s gambling debts—mostly because he had no money to do so, though he wouldn’t admit it. Defying her father’s orders to go to her room, Shallan offered up what little she and her brothers had to buy Jushu back, and for the first time (IIRC) we saw someone else beaten specifically for something Shallan had done.</p>
<p>Now we find that the pattern has been established: when she in any way angers her father, he beats someone else in her name. The only defense a 14-year-old has in that case, I think, is the one Shallan has used for the past 15 months: she became a “perfect” daughter so that no one else would get hurt.</p>
<blockquote><p>What would happen if Balat left? He backed down from fights with Father, but at least he resisted. Wikim merely did what he was told, and Jushu was still a mess. <em>We have to just weather this</em>, Shallan thought. <em>Stop provoking Father, let him relax. Then he’ll come back</em>….</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s certainly what I’d have done. “Let’s all just do what he wants, stop resisting, and maybe he’ll get better.” Unfortunately, their attempts at passivity don’t seem to have helped Lin any, and it seems pretty clear that Balat’s pitiful resistance is not enough to have the spiraling negative effects that are in evidence. That’s because they are, of course, reckoning without the influence of Odium on their father, plus whatever manipulation the Ghostbloods are doing. He’s getting worse and worse.</p>
<p>To rub salt in the wound, there’s another reminder that Lin Davar wasn’t always a bad-tempered man:</p>
<blockquote><p>Surely that would make him start laughing again. Surely that would drive the darkness from his eyes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shallan unmistakably remembers a time when her father laughed often, and was the kind of man who loved and enjoyed his little daughter as much as she loved and enjoyed him. Whether that was a daddy-daughter link that excluded his sons, we really don’t know; they don’t seem to have the same loving memories of earlier years, but it’s possible that all their earlier memories are tainted by the belief that he murdered their mother. Shallan knows that not only did he not commit murder, he’s allowing them to think he did because he’s protecting his little girl… so her memories of a devoted father are unaffected.</p>
<p><em>::sniffle::</em> Gah! Every time I think about that particular dynamic, it makes me even sadder.</p>
<p>ANYWAY. The topic of contention today is Balat’s declared intent to marry Eylita, who Lin has decided is much too low-ranked for him. No, his son and avowed heir must marry <em>up</em>, and as high up as he can manage. (I wonder if anyone at all besides the now-twisted Lin Davar would be serious about marrying the 21-year-old Balat to Highprince Valam’s fifty-something daughter. Oy.)</p>
<p>Sadly, Balat’s attempt to stand up for himself on this particular day has two very negative results: One, Lord Davar uses Balat’s one healthy pursuit (breeding axehounds) against him, tainting the only thing besides Eylita that was holding him together. Two, Balat spills a secret not meant to be shared by telling his father that Helaran is back… thereby setting up an assassination attempt on Helaran, and a new hostility between Lin and Malise. And we know where that’s going to end.</p>
<p>Speaking of Malise, though, this is the first time she’s felt like more than a bland placeholder. I could love her solely for this:</p>
<blockquote><p>“How dare you,” said a feminine voice from within.</p>
<p>Stunned silence followed. Shallan edged back to look into the room. Malise, her stepmother, stood in the doorway between the bedroom and the sitting room. The small, plump woman had never seemed threatening to Shallan before. But the storm on her face today could have frightened a whitespine.</p>
<p>“Your own <em>son</em>,” Malise said. “Have you no morals left? Have you no compassion?”</p></blockquote>
<p>*sigh* This glimpse of backbone was sweet at the time, even though she did follow it up with, “It is one thing to beat the servants, but to kill your own <em>son</em>?” (Eurgh!) There was some hope for her to turn out well, for a few minutes here…</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>This takes place one and a half years prior to the “present” action, and about one and a half years after the previous flashback, when Shallan bought Jushu back from his creditors. Shallan is about a week past her sixteenth birthday in this scene.</p>
<h4><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h4>
<p>Painspren, for Balat’s anguish over the pitiful remains of the axehound pups he’d been breeding. That is all.</p>
<h4><strong>All Creatures Shelled and Feathered</strong></h4>
<p>Stepping back from Balat’s reaction to the fate of his latest batch of pups, there are a couple of interesting notes. One is simply that one of the ways Balat has been coping with life has been to develop an interest in breeding axehounds. In focusing on the creation of new life, he’s made progress against his old habits of destroying life; now, he rarely hurts anything larger than a cremling. Which… is still a bit creepy, but it’s better than relishing axehound fights. I guess.</p>
<p>Anyway, the other interesting thing is that axehounds apparently produce pups in pods. The question I have now is this: Is “pod” a nomenclature thing, like a pod of whales? Or is it a physical thing, like the egg case of a locust? Just for the sake of Rosharan ecological weirdness, I’m guessing it’s the latter. But I think I’d prefer the former.</p>
<h4><strong>Ars Mechanica</strong></h4>
<p>While there’s no direct mention of the Soulcaster yet, I think it’s hinted here for the first time, suitably accompanied a few paragraphs later by the first appearance of the new steward Luesh.</p>
<blockquote><p>But surely… surely things would get better now. Indeed, as Shallan was involved more by the ardents in accounts, she noted a shrewdness to the way her father stopped being bullied by other lighteyes and started playing them against each other. He impressed her, but frightened her, in how he seized for power. Father’s fortunes changed further when a new marble deposit was discovered on his lands—providing resources to keep up with his promises, bribes, and deals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether Davar’s new shrewdness was the cause or the result of Ghostblood attentions isn’t entirely clear, though I think it reads more like the former. In either case, the new marble deposit is certainly the latter, and is plainly instrumental in encouraging his ambitions.</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Chach and Nalan grace the arch for this poor chapter. I believe Chach is partly for Obedience, and partly for Shallan’s odd role (the youngest child, and the only girl) as Guard for her family. Regarding Nalan, though, I am—as usual—less certain. Is it simply the references to Helaran and his yet-unknown association with the Skybreakers? Is it the twisting of Justice? The new Confidence of Shallan’s father? I’m really open to suggestions here, folks.</p>
<h4><strong>Shipping Wars</strong></h4>
<p>Am I the only person who thinks that Eylita is crazy to take Balat? Not only is he the scion of a fairly questionable house—even if he is several dahn above her—but he’s certifiably nuts. I feel sorry for him, very much, but I can’t help thinking this <em>has</em> to be a very unhealthy relationship.</p>
<h4><strong>Just Sayin’</strong></h4>
<p>Favorite metaphor:</p>
<blockquote><p>She entered the manor, but couldn’t help feeling that she was trying to hold together a carpet as dozens of people pulled out threads from the sides.</p></blockquote>
<p>That sounds like fun, eh?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well. On that cheery note, I’ll see you in the comments for your reactions. That ought to keep us busy until next <del> week </del>time, when we return to Kaladin’s prison cell for further ill-timed revelations. Yeah, sorry, no sunshine there either.</p>
<p>Editing to add: There will be no reread post next week, November 26. I&#8217;m taking Thanksgiving week off. So for all you USA types, happy Thanksgiving! For everyone else&#8230; uh&#8230; sorry? (Now I sound Canadian!) Anyway&#8230; use the opportunity to dig deeply into the flashbacks, or go reread both epigraph-letters, or something else fun. Back in two weeks!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 60: Veil Walks</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Shallan’s room in Sebarial’s manor<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Pattern, Palah, Chach</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Shallan compares maps, searching for hints of Urithiru; small foreshadowings are dropped; Pattern attempts to comprehend human complexities like sleep and humor; he suggests that she once knew how to make her Illusions produce sound, and she goes blank; Shallan returns to her maps, presenting an argument for interpreting Stormseat to be in the middle of the Shattered Plains; she is convinced that the way to Urithiru is via Oathgate, and that there should be one in the ruins of Stormseat; Pattern again urges her to remember the skills she once knew, and she blanks again; he doesn’t let up this time, and she creates an Illusion of the broken, wretched girl she believes she would be if she let herself remember; she turns away again from the possibility of remembering, and draws Veil again, then turns her into an Illusion; when she walks away, the Illusion goes fuzzy; with instinct, experimentation, and leaps of intuition, she feeds Stormlight into Pattern and attaches the Illusion to him… and now it can move. </em></p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“Shallan,” Pattern said, moving closer to her. “I know that you have forgotten much of what once was. Those lies attracted me. But you cannot continue like this; you must admit the truth about me. About what I can do, and what we have done. Mmm &#8230; More, you <em>must</em> know yourself. And remember.”</p>
<p>She sat cross-legged on the too-nice bed. Memories tried to claw their way out of the boxes inside her head. Those memories all pointed one way, toward carpet bloodied. And carpet &#8230; not.</p>
<p>“You wish to help,” Pattern said. “You wish to prepare for the Everstorm, the spren of the unnatural one. You must become something. I did not come to you merely to teach you tricks of light.”</p>
<p>“You came to learn,” Shallan said, staring at her map. “That’s what you said.”</p>
<p>“I came to learn. We became to do something greater.”</p>
<p>“Would you have me unable to laugh?” she demanded, suddenly holding back tears. “Would you have me crippled? That is what those memories would do to me. I can <em>be</em> what I <em>am</em> because I cut them off.”</p>
<p>An image formed in front of her, born of Stormlight, created by instinct. She hadn’t needed to draw this image first, for she knew it too well.</p>
<p>The image was of herself. Shallan, as she <em>should</em> be. Curled in a huddle on the bed, unable to weep for she had long since run out of tears. This girl &#8230; not a woman, a girl &#8230; flinched whenever spoken to. She expected everyone to shout at her. She could not laugh, for laughter had been squeezed from her by a childhood of darkness and pain.</p>
<p>That was the real Shallan. She knew it as surely as she knew her own name. The person she had become instead was a lie, one she had fabricated in the name of survival. To remember herself as a child, discovering Light in the gardens, Patterns in the stonework, and dreams that became real &#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>“Mmmm &#8230; Such a deep lie,” Pattern whispered. “A deep lie indeed. But still, you must obtain your abilities. Learn again, if you have to.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A long, long time ago, people used to dislike Shallan because she was a spoiled, entitled, flippant little brat. I remember thinking after the beta read that they might not necessarily <em>like</em> her after reading WoR, but they would certainly see her differently.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>I find it oddly amusing that some of the information that will be crucial to the endgame of this book is slipped into this chapter so casually, and is so quickly covered up by other events. We don’t have the old maps of Natanatan showing a presumed location for Stormseat, but we do have a map of the Silver Kingdoms (front endpapers of TWoK); we also have the new map of the Unclaimed Hills &amp; Shattered Plains – the back endpapers and the map on pp 14-15 of WoR, which sound exactly like what Pattern is describing. Shallan has obviously overlaid the two, recognized that the Shattered Plains &amp; Unclaimed Hills form what was once Natanatan… and made the connection that the capital city might likely be on the (pre-shattered) plains rather than in the mountains.</p>
<p>As it turns out, of course, not only is Stormseat on the Plains, it seems to have been the focal point for whatever shattered them.</p>
<p>The copy of the copy of the copy of the mosaic, while it looks like a pretty but mostly artsy representation of the city, turns out to be absolutely critical in the end, identifying the tower that still stands and the relative off-center location of that perfectly round plateau. (It’s also interesting to look at this map in light of the last Eshonai interlude – the tower where the Five meet, the round plateau that forms the practice grounds, etc. <em>::sigh::</em>)</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WoR_MAP-STORMSEAT_COLOR.jpg?fit=0%2C%209999&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-196278" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WoR_MAP-STORMSEAT_COLOR.jpg?fit=740%2C%209999&#038;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C500px" alt="WoR_MAP-STORMSEAT_COLOR" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Other tidbits that get dropped here: Adolin is preoccupied with something; Dalinar is “sick” and being attended by Navani; Shallan has slipped hints about “something valuable” into  her reports to Palona, hoping to interest Sebarial in an expedition; and Shallan’s brothers have failed to respond to her letters asking them to join her.</p>
<p>On to the central focus of the chapter, though… This is the first time, IIRC, that Shallan directly confronts the fact that she is deliberately blocking her memories. Then again, it’s also the first time Pattern presses her on it and refuses to back off when she blanks out. And blank she does – three times in as many minutes, I think. At long last, though, Pattern ignores her attempts to ignore him and divert the discussion, and presses her to remember; she simply can’t afford to cripple herself by this continued hiding from her memories.</p>
<p>It doesn’t entirely work; while she finally faces the knowledge that she is deliberately blocking her memories, she doesn’t stop blocking them. I think, though, that this is the beginning of her eventual readiness to face the past and then move on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>This chapter takes place four days after the previous one; coincidentally, the same day as the Eshonai interlude we covered a couple of weeks ago. There are 22 days left in the countdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h4>
<p>Pattern is such a hoot. Humor FTW. One of my favorite exchanges in the whole book is right here:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Annoying!” she snapped.</p>
<p>Pattern hummed. “I’m sorry that your mystical, godlike powers do not instantly work as you would like them to.”</p>
<p>She raised an eyebrow at him. “I thought you didn’t understand humor.”</p>
<p>“I do. I just explained . . .” He paused for a moment. “Was I being funny? Sarcasm. I was <em>sarcastic</em>. By accident!” He seemed surprised, even gleeful.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is, of course, after the conversation where she made a smart remark and Pattern got into a dissection of humor, making it as not-funny as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ars Arcanum</strong></h4>
<p>Since Shallan can’t/won’t confront her actual memories, she’s pretty intent on starting from scratch rather than remembering the things she used to do. Apparently, in so doing she actually discovers something she <em>hadn’t</em> been able to do before – at least, it doesn’t appear to be something familiar to Pattern. At one time, she’d been able to make her Illusions speak. Now, she can make them move without her direct intervention (by attaching them to Pattern), and she can make them stable at a distance by giving Pattern extra Investiture to support them. It’s really pretty cool, because you can envision all sorts of tricks. She hasn’t done it yet, but I’d love to read a scene where she creates one Illusion for Pattern to carry, and another for herself, and then walks down the street having a conversation between the two of them. Heh. It would be so much fun. And just think of all the ways Pattern could tell her off! Or tell her jokes. Whichever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Palah is clearly here as the Scholar; she might also be shown as the patron of Elsecallers, pointing up  Shallan’s thoughts about Jasnah’s studies and conclusions. Chach isn’t quite so clear, but oddly enough, I think she might represent Pattern’s role in his bond with Shallan at this point… though I just realized that I can’t possibly articulate what I mean by that. Sorry&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Shipping Wars</strong></h4>
<p>I’m amused that Shallan begins this chapter focusing on scholarship, because Adolin is “preoccupied” with something else. Heh. But we’re not talking about that yet, la-la-la-la.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when we go flash back to one of those blocked memories… I’d forgotten how depressing this section of the book could be!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 59: Fleet</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Kaladin<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Kholin warcamp prison<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Spears, Nalan, Joker</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Kaladin complains about his too-nice prison cell; he hears a lot of unintelligible shouting down the hall; he considers trying to draw Stormlight from the lamp outside his cell; he also considers the possibility of breaking out; he argues with Syl about Dalinar, Elhokar, and Syl’s statement that it would be different this time; Wit makes snarky remarks from a bench outside the cell; Kaladin is surly about it; Wit begins playing his strange musical instrument, asking Kaladin what he sees; Kaladin finally responds, and Wit builds the story of Fleet around Kaladin’s responses; the interpretation is unclear; Wit leaves.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“Dalinar can go rot. He let this happen.”</p>
<p>“He tried to—”</p>
<p>“He let it happen!” Kaladin snapped, turning and slamming his hands against the bars. Another <em>storming</em> cage. He was right back where he’d begun! “He’s the same as the others,” Kaladin growled.</p>
<p>Syl zipped over to him, coming to rest between the bars, hands on hips. “Say that again.”</p>
<p>“He…” Kaladin turned away. Lying to her was hard. “All right, fine. He’s not. But the king is. Admit it, Syl. Elhokar is a terrible king. At first he <em>lauded</em> me for trying to protect him. Now, at the snap of his fingers, he’s willing to execute me. He’s a child.”</p>
<p>“Kaladin, you’re scaring me.”</p>
<p>“Am I? You told me to trust you, Syl. When I jumped down into the arena, you said this time things would be different. <em>How</em> is this different?”</p>
<p>She looked away, seeming suddenly very small.</p>
<p>“Even Dalinar admitted that the king had made a big mistake in letting Sadeas wiggle out of the challenge,” Kaladin said. “Moash and his friends are right. This kingdom would be better off without Elhokar.”</p>
<p>Syl dropped to the floor, head bowed.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s impossible, now, <em>not</em> to see the beginnings of the broken bond in this argument. <em>::sniffle::</em></p>
<p>Also: Kaladin, if things aren’t any different this time, it’s your own storming fault. Quit blaming everyone else—especially Syl—for the results of <em>your</em> impetuous behavior. Sure, Elhokar did something stupid. But you did something stupid first, setting up the situation. Stop playing I’m Just A Victim Here, and admit your own culpability.</p>
<p>Question: Why doesn’t Syl point this out to him? Does she not see it? Or is she not allowed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>Thus begins Part Four: The Approach. While the title may have many other implications, the most transparent is that this entire Part is leading up to the march on Narak and the Everstorm. The last chapter in Part Four includes the final bit of decision-making, and the first chapter in Part Five is the staging of the combined armies.</p>
<p>For now, though… here sits Kaladin, sulking in his cell, convinced that everything is someone else’s fault—the lighteyes, the king, the spren, anyone but himself. He’s a bitter, bitter man right now, and that bitterness is already beginning to work its way out in all manner of downward-spiraling ways. It’s not only making him miserable, it’s making Syl miserable, and it’s eating away at their bond. He’s letting it interfere with the truths he knows about Dalinar, and blocking his ability to see new truth as it is presented. I’m actually surprised that Wit managed to get through to him at all, in this state. I guess there’s something to be said for a captive audience.</p>
<p>(Okay, groan. Yes, I know. I did it on purpose.)</p>
<p>The thing that’s really bugging me is that, in general, I <em>like</em> Kaladin, and I like all he’s set up to become. He’s a natural leader in many ways, and he’s all about protecting those he considers his responsibility. That’s great, and it suits a Windrunner very well. What I dislike is that he thinks he wants to be a team player—but he wants to do it on his own terms. It doesn’t work that way—especially when you aren’t qualified to be the coach.</p>
<p>Moving on… I had to snicker a bit at Wit’s appearance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kaladin scrambled up to his feet. Wit sat on a bench by the far wall, outside the cell and under the spheres, tuning some kind of strange instrument on his lap made of taut strings and polished wood. He hadn’t been there a moment ago. Storms&#8230; had the <em>bench</em> even been there before?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a good question. Heh.</p>
<p>I love the way Wit goads Kaladin into making suggestions about the story: he plays his harp (or whatever it is—electric guitar?) and waits for Kaladin to tell him what the music provokes in his imagination. Each time Kaladin makes a statement, Wit turns it into a versified chant, expanding on it and explaining <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the</span> <em>a </em>background for the suggestion, never actually going beyond what Kaladin said. Then he waits until Kaladin moves the story forward again. So in large part, it’s a story about Kaladin, or at least about Kaladin’s frame of mind.</p>
<p>Essentially, it’s a story about a legendary runner named Fleet, who could outrun anything, even the Herald Chanarach. Eventually, with no one left to challenge, he challenged the highstorm itself, running before the storm across the entire continent. It almost caught him in the central mountains, but then he reached the divide and gained ground. Again, it almost caught him in the mountains guarding Shinovar, but he managed to stay ahead of it, if only just. His strength finally failed and he collapsed… but the storm was spent as well, and could not pass the point where he fell.</p>
<p>Even though it was (at least in one sense) his own bad-tempered statement that ended the story there, Kaladin is shocked that Wit agrees with him, that Fleet died. But… the story isn’t over.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Upon that land of dirt and soil,” Wit shouted, “our hero fell and did not stir! His body spent, his strength undone, Fleet the hero was no more.</p>
<p>“The storm approached and found him there. It stilled and stopped upon its course! The rains they fell, the winds they blew, but forward they could not progress.</p>
<p>“For glory lit, and life alive, for goals unreached and aims to strive. All men must try, the wind did see. It is the test, it is the dream.”</p>
<p>Kaladin stepped slowly up to the bars. Even with eyes open, he could see it. Imagine it.</p>
<p>“So in that land of dirt and soil, our hero stopped the storm itself. And while the rain came down like tears, our Fleet refused to end this race. His body dead, but not his will, within those winds his soul did <em>rise</em>.</p>
<p>“It flew upon the day’s last song, to win the race and claim the dawn. Past the sea and past the waves, our Fleet no longer lost his breath. Forever strong, forever fast, forever free to race the wind.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Kaladin (and perhaps the reader) is left wondering what it means, because stories have meaning. But when he asks Wit, the answer is merely that since it’s Kaladin’s story, he must decide what it meant.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The storm caught him,” Kaladin said.</p>
<p>“The storm catches everyone, eventually. Does it matter?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Good.” Wit tipped his sword up toward his forehead, as if in respect. “Then you have something to think about.”</p>
<p>He left.</p></blockquote>
<p>I love that ending. And I should probably have ended with it, but I have to comment. (Hey, it’s my job, right?) It’s an amazing story for a developing Windrunner, one who can indeed race the wind and win (as long as he doesn’t run out of Stormlight). Sadly, Kaladin is too lost in his own personal frustrations to see the connection, and we have no evidence he actually spent any time thinking further about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>This chapter takes place on Kaladin’s third day in prison—the first being the day of the duel—so there are now 26 days left in the countdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h4>
<p>Oh, my poor dear Sylphrena. Watching her <em>droop</em> in this chapter is painful, especially now that we know where this attitude of Kaladin’s is leading. *sigh*</p>
<p>There are a couple of other interesting notes, though. One odd tidbit I noticed was that part of Kaladin’s complaint about his cell was the lack of exposure; he missed the wind. The solitude wasn’t an issue, the lack of <em>wind</em> was. Is this significant of his connection to windspren through his honorspren? Or is it just a general lack-of-fresh-air problem?</p>
<p>Another (though it seems “old news” by now, we were pretty enthusiastic when we first saw it) was this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>She lifted her chin. “I’m no highspren. Laws don’t matter; what’s right matters.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Highspren have, I believe, been confirmed as the Skybreaker-spren; this highlights a major difference between honorspren &amp; highspren—and therefore, between Windrunners and Skybreakers—and one that we should all be cognizant of, even for ourselves. There is sometimes a distinction between what is legal and what is moral; there is even, sometimes, a case where moral conduct requires opposition to an unjust law. Even more than real life (for most of us), Roshar seems to have plenty of these cases, from Alethkar to Shinovar. Realistic worldbuilding FTW?</p>
<p>It does make me wonder: in the old days, was there frequent conflict between Skybreakers who judged guilt or innocence solely according to law, and Windrunners who judged action according to moral values rather than legal? Where did the other Orders fit along this spectrum, or did they care?</p>
<p>Back to the chapter…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Haven’t We Met Somewhere Before?</strong></h4>
<p>Well, hello, Hoid. Lightweaving, or just personal insight and clever storytelling?</p>
<p>Also, this little Easter egg regarding other places he’s been and things he’s done:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wit leaned down to tune his instrument, one leg crossed over the other. He hummed softly to himself and nodded. “Perfect pitch,” Wit said, “makes this all so much easier than it once was….”</p></blockquote>
<p>I think we can take it as a given that he holds at least 200 Breaths, just in case you were curious. I suppose it’s possible there are other ways he could have acquired perfect pitch, but this is the sort of thing Brandon throws in for the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">obsessive</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through">overly detail-oriented</span> <em>very thorough</em> among us to find and squee over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staging Note: the epigraphs of Part Four form a letter which responds to the letter of the TWoK Part Two epigraphs. Feel free to comment on them as we go, particularly if you notice a connection between the epigraph and the chapter content. I, however, will be dealing with them in total as a separate post at the end of Part Four, just before the next set of Interludes. Just so you know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Nalan, Judge, Herald of Justice and patron of the Skybreakers. Because Kaladin deserves to be in prison? Because he doesn’t? Because Syl mentions the highspren? The Joker, wild card, jester, Wit. Because Wit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well. That was cheery. Let’s go hit the comment thread, and then come back next week for a much more positive chapter—at long last—as Shallan starts out practicing Scholarship and ends up practicing Lightweaving.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Interlude 11: New Rhythms</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Eshonai<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Narak<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Listener, Kalak, Ishar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> stormform Eshonai meets with the Five plus Venli to discuss the plan she has developed for fighting the humans—to get everyone possible into stormform; she lies and manipulates them to gain some cooperation; Venli is still keeping secrets; Eshonai circumvents the Five, announcing the immediate implementation of her plan; the sisters go out to the practice grounds, where Eshonai again announces her plan, requiring each soldier to choose immediately whether or not to join her in stormform; once the few who refuse the transformation are identified, she sends her soldiers to do the same among the civilians; all those who refuse are gathered with those few soldiers on the practice ground; Eshonai attunes her new Rhythms to block out any hints of self-awareness; when her old lieutenant indicates discomfort with the proceedings, she puts him and her former division in charge of the dissenters, knowing that she will have all of them executed once she’s got most of the people in stormform; she returns to the city, prepared to tell her people a concoction of lies to keep them in line; while she waits for the people to gather and settle for her speech, she is informed that the dissenters have escaped into the chasms; despite Venli and her spite, Eshonai shrugs them off as essentially dead already, since they cannot possibly get far enough away via the chasms before the next highstorm hits.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>“Our people <em>must</em> take that form, Eshonai,” Venli said. “It is inevitable.”</p>
<p>Eshonai found herself attuning the new version of Amusement… Ridicule, it was. She turned to her sister. “You knew, didn’t you? You knew <em>exactly</em> what this form would do to me. You knew this before you took the form yourself.”</p>
<p>“I… Yes.”</p>
<p>Eshonai grabbed her sister by the front of her robe, then yanked her forward, holding her tightly. With Shardplate it was easy, though Venli resisted more than she should have been able to, and a small spark of red lightning ran across the woman’s arms and face. Eshonai was not accustomed to such strength from her scholar of a sister.</p>
<p>“You could have destroyed us,” Eshonai said. “What if this form had done something terrible?”</p>
<p>Screaming. In her head. Venli smiled.</p>
<p>“How did you discover this?” Eshonai asked. “It didn’t come from the songs. There is more.”</p>
<p>Venli did not speak. She met Eshonai’s eyes and hummed to Confidence. “We must make certain the Five agree to this plan,” she said. “If we are to survive, and if we are to defeat the humans, we must be in this form—all of us. We <em>must</em> summon that storm. It has been … waiting, Eshonai. Waiting and building.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The new Eshonai makes me sad; I liked the old Eshonai, the one who is still screaming in her own mind, and I still hope she will somehow return. Venli, on the other hand… I never liked or trusted the old Venli, and the new one is even worse. She tacitly admits that she’s still keeping secrets.</p>
<p>I can’t help thinking that the only thing worse than these two and their spiteful semi-cooperation would be these two truly working together as a team.<em> ::shudder::</em></p>
<h3><strong>Commentary</strong></h3>
<p>This chapter makes me melancholy. It’s so <em>hard</em> to watch Eshonai under the control of the stormspren, and it’s made worse by the ways in which she <em>almost</em> recognizes the differences. Between her own voice screaming at her from the Rhythm of Peace, the differences in the Rhythms she can hear, and the repeatedly slippery recognitions of behavior that is not quite natural, it’s pretty clear that there’s still something of the old Eshonai buried in there, and that the new Eshonai is being controlled by another entity.</p>
<p>The big question I have now, though, is whether that buried Eshonai is being clever—if desperate—in a few things. Specifically, did she deliberately put her “former friends” in charge of the dissidents, a group which includes her own mother, <em>knowing</em> that they would figure out what she was going to do to them and that they would attempt to escape? She shrugs off their departure just a shade too easily, and Venli accuses her of doing <em>something</em> deliberately, though even super-sneak Venli doesn’t seem to know quite what it might be. Earlier, Eshonai almost acknowledged something weird about the way she didn’t choose her own squad for the first group to transform; later, she consciously thinks that it was nice of Thude to make it so easy to get rid of him and the rest of her old squad. Combining this with the knowledge that the last we see of her in this book is as she’s falling into the chasms herself, I have to wonder. Did old-Eshonai, buried deep within, subtly manipulate new-Eshonai into setting up the dissidents to escape rather than be executed? And will that one little nudge end up being the thing that saves her life and her soul? I can hope…</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it’s deeply uncomfortable to be in her head as she displays impatience and contempt for so many of the people that she’s spent all these years leading and protecting. This new arrogance is revolting after the careful, humble stewardship we saw earlier.</p>
<p>I’m not going to recount every episode that caught my attention on the way through here, but I have to point out a few things. The “new rhythms” that give the chapter its title are creepy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Buried within those new rhythms, the names of which she intuited somehow, she could almost hear voices speaking to her. Advising her. If her people had received such guidance over the centuries, they surely would not have fallen so far.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ick.</p>
<p>There’s also the way those new rhythms make other people nervous. Is that simply because the rhythms are unfamiliar, because the others can’t hear the Rhythm she’s using? Or is there something in the rhythms themselves that causes uneasiness in those not (yet) attuned to the Voidbringer spren? It would be an interesting exercise to make a list of all the old and new Rhythms, and see how many direct correspondences there are, of the sort Eshonai makes between Amusement and “the new version of Amusement… Ridicule, it was.” Are all the new ones all a bitter twist on the old ones?</p>
<p>There are also repeated mentions of the red eyes, which she and Venli both have. During the meeting of the Five, Abronai whispers to himself, “Red eyes. Have we come to this?” Later, Eshonai thinks that her old friends will have to be executed, because she’d instilled in them too much fear of the old gods; they don’t trust her because of her red eyes. (Wise folk, these…)</p>
<p>Tied to that, I had to notice the number of times she can’t quite explain her own actions, and as noted above, I grasp at straws of hope that the old Eshonai can still be recovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h3>
<p>This Interlude actually jumps forward in time just a little; it takes place on the same day as the upcoming Chapter 60, six days after the last few chapters of Part Three.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h3>
<p>Oh, the spren, the spren, the spren. What is the “cometlike” spren Eshonai keeps trying to chase away? Is it possibly the spren that was displaced when she took stormform? It certainly seems to be connected to her former self, anyway. Is it part of the screaming? And is it in any way similar to the way dead Shardblades scream when touched by a Radiant?</p>
<p>Then there are the stormspren. Thousands and thousands of them. Why are there suddenly so <em>many</em> of them around for Venli to collect? Were they always there, or are they now being <em>sent</em>? If the latter, by whom? Questions, questions. They also seem to have an… interesting effect on the local windspren:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s clear sky rained down white sunlight, and a few windspren approached on a breeze. They stopped when they grew near, then zipped away in the opposite direction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Best guess, windspren are too closely related to Honor-spren to be comfortable approaching Odium-influenced spren. Thoughts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h3>
<p>I have to think that the Heralds on this interlude reflect the very twisted versions of their attributes presented by Eshonai and Venli. Kalak, the Maker, with his divine attributes of Resolute and Builder, is inversely reflected in Eshonai’s resolute direction of her people; she’s building them, all right, but building them into the antithesis of everything they’ve believed for centuries. Ishar, the Priest, with his attributes of Pious and Guiding, is reflected in Venli’s careful collection of the spren of their old gods, guiding the Listeners back to the Voidbringers they once served.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when we dive into Part Four with bitter, gloomy Kaladin. Things just keep getting cheerier and cheerier up in here.</p>
<p class="squib"><a href="http://www.tor.com/Alice-Arneson"><strong>Alice Arneson</strong></a> is a long-time Tor.com commenter and Sanderson beta-reader. She is still moderately astonished every time another best-seller hits the shelves and she finds her name in the acknowledgements; that’s just bizarre. Fun, though.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Interlude 10: Szeth</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Szeth<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Urithiru<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Assassin, Vedeledev</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Szeth sits on the top of Urithiru and contemplates the things he has done; having fought someone who held and used Stormlight, he faces the possibility that the past eight years have been based on a lie; he departs Urithiru, falling toward a place he hopes to find answers. </em></p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“What does it mean if the Shamanate are wrong? What does it mean if they banished me in error?”</p>
<p>It meant the End of All Things. The end of truth. It would mean that nothing made sense, and that his oath was meaningless.</p>
<p>It would mean he had killed for no reason.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well. Not so sure about that “end of truth, nothing makes sense” part, frankly, in my opinion, it <em>never </em>made sense to send someone out with an Honorblade and orders to implicitly obey anyone who picks up his Oathstone. Seriously, people? I mean, what could <em>possibly</em> go wrong?</p>
<p>But that last? Yeah, it means that. For. No. Reason.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>Every now and then, I do feel a little bit sorry for Szeth. I mean, he was trying so hard to obey the rules no matter what the cost. But then… I think about the cost, and I don’t feel sorry for him anymore. Yes, the cost was high&mdash;but he’s not the one who paid it. And frankly, <em>this</em> makes me want to kick him:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screamers deserved their deaths, of course. They should have killed Szeth.</p></blockquote>
<p>This, and thoughts like this, which we’ve seen before and will again, when we’re in his head. Even as he murders more and more people, he seems to increasingly think of himself as the victim. “Oh, poor me. All those people I murdered scream at me every time I close my eyes. Poor, poor me. Life’s really hard when you can’t close your eyes.” Gah. Self-identification as  Victim makes me want to hurl.</p>
<p>On a lighter note (for a few minutes), this short interlude gives us a truckload of hints and snippets of information. This is our first actual glimpse of Urithiru, a hundred terraced  stories high, with that odd, flat, windowed, eastern wall. Whatever it may once have been, and whatever it will become, at this point Szeth seems to be the only person who knows exactly where it is <em>and</em> has the capability to get there.</p>
<p>However, given that he considers it “the only place in the East where the stones were not cursed, where walking on them was allowed,” it seems probable that the Stone Shamans know of it. It’s even possible that they know exactly where it is, I suppose, and that he found it based on existing maps. This train of thought brings a whole series of questions about the Stone Shamans, though. Do they train with the Honorblades? Are there traditionally one or more individuals among them who practice the Surgebinding that comes with the eight Honorblades they’ve been “protecting” for the last few millennia? Have they had them that whole time? If not, when did they acquire them? Which one do they not have, besides Taln’s? Who does have that one? In the later Interlude, is Taravangian telling the truth about another Blade going missing, or is that something he made up on the spot to distract Szeth? And does Szeth have the Honorblade <em>because</em> he was named Truthless, or had he already been “gifted” it for life, or…? <em>Why</em> did he have it?  So many questions.</p>
<p>But we at least learned here, clearly(ish) stated for the first time, that the “crime” for which Szeth was named Truthless was a claim that either the Voidbringers or the Radiants (or both, or one implying the other) were returning. The Stone Shamans insisted that it was a false alarm, that the Voidbringers are no more, the powers of old (Surgebinding via spren?) are no more, the Knights Radiant are fallen, the Stone Shamans are all that remain. Which is… manifestly false. Did they know it was false? Were they deceiving themselves? Did they really believe Surgebinding was gone forever? Did they know the truth, but perpetrated a lie to maintain control? I hope we get some answers eventually. For now, we know that they were committed to a set of beliefs that were flat-out <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>It reminds me of an odd discussion I had this summer about the nature of reality. From my perspective, reality just <em>is</em>. We may perceive reality differently, depending on our basic assumptions, and we may attribute observable phenomena to different causes depending on those assumptions, and in some cases our perceptions and attributions vary rather dramatically. My argument was that our <em>beliefs</em> may be correct or incorrect, but <em>reality</em> is immutable. We each have a responsibility to decide what to believe, and we each have a right to our own beliefs, but those beliefs don’t change <em>reality itself</em>. The argument of my friend was that our perceptions determine reality, so that we each have a reality all our own; her example was that for George over there who is colorblind, certain colors don’t exist in his reality. My counter to that was that George’s inability to perceive red and green as distinct colors doesn’t make them any less a part of reality.</p>
<p>(The funny part is that the debate began with her insistence that no intelligent person could possibly believe a cosmology different than what she believed, because Science. Since I consider myself reasonably intelligent but hold to a very different cosmology, I pointed out that both views rest on a set of assumptions, and a scientist in particular should at least acknowledge that there are unprovable assumptions involved. She didn’t want to admit that all theories of origins <em>have</em> to make some assumptions, and next thing I knew, “reality” was being redefined. Not quite sure how “Science Irrefutably Proves This” suddenly became “Reality Is Defined By Perception” but… oh well.)</p>
<p><em>Anyway</em>… Back to Roshar. There was Szeth, thinking that the Stone Shamans knew the truth, and believing that when they named him Truthless for saying something else, they <em>must</em> have been right, so off he went to obey the rules for being Truthless. Then he met up with Kaladin, who clearly could do at least some of the stuff that was supposed to be impossible in this day and age… and suddenly his perception ran head-on into the brick wall of reality. Suddenly the all-knowing Stone Shamans turned out to be <em>completely wrong</em>, meaning that despite all their declarations, he was <em>not</em>, in fact, Truthless… and there was no justification for the rules he followed after all.</p>
<p>Okay, I <em>can</em> feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>But what kind of special irrationality does it take?&mdash;to give someone an Honorblade which not only can’t be beaten, but also bestows Surgebinding skills on the holder… and then send him out with a rock in his hand, bound to give the rock to anyone that wants it, and then to obey whatever orders they choose to give him&mdash;good, bad, or indifferent. That’s just stupid irresponsible nonsense.</p>
<p>Szeth did the deeds, and he is guilty no matter whose rules he was following. But IMO, the Stone Shamans are every bit as guilty as Szeth, since they gave him the power to do those deeds. Likewise guilty are the masters he’s obeyed, because they used the tool at hand to commit evil deeds. Perception be damned; the reality is that a whole host of people were murdered <em>with no justification whatsoever</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>This interlude takes place somewhere along the line of the past two Rosharan weeks, or roughly during the timespan of Part Three.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Vedeledev watches over this chapter alone, and I have to admit that I’m slightly baffled by her presence. Why is the Healer, patron Herald of the Edgedancers, associated with this hot mess?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Just Sayin’</strong></h4>
<p>“Glories within.” On a guess, this is a Shin idiom; no one else seems to say it, anyway. It certainly serves as a reminder that there’s a whole raft of stuff we really don’t know about the people, culture, and religion of Shinovar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we can try to figure out what charges a prosecutor would bring against Szeth, how on earth a defense attorney could possibly make a case for him, how the jury would rule, and what sentence the judge would be likely to hand down. Or… not. It’s up to you where the comments roll this week! Next week, we’ll look in on Eshonai and the new rhythms she’s attuning these days. This also will be an uncheerful episode, methinks. For now, I’ll see you in the comments!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Interlude 9: Lift</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Lift<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>The Bronze Palace, Azimir<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Copia, Vedeledev, Nalan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Lift and her spren Wyndle enter the Bronze Palace through an upper window, and assist a small group of thieves to enter as well; while the others search for disposable goods, Lift sets off in search of food, followed by the awkward Gawx; he chooses to raid the viziers’ quarters, while she aims for the party food; she succeeds, but is followed and captured by Darkness and his henchmen; she escapes, but they have also captured Gawx and present him as hostage; she calls their bluff, but it wasn’t a bluff; she escapes, but returns to perform her first Regrowth to keep Gawx from dying; Darkness prepares to execute her, but Gawx, now named the new Aqasix, declares her pardoned of her thievery; Darkness departs.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“Why… why do you hunt me?”</p>
<p>“In the name of justice.”</p>
<p>“There are <em>tons</em> of people who do wrong things,” she said. She had to force out every word. Talking was hard. <em>Thinking</em> was hard. So tired. “You… you coulda hunted big crime bosses, murderers. You chose me instead. Why?”</p>
<p>“Others may be detestable, but they do not dabble in arts that could return Desolation to this world.” His words were so cold. “What you are must be stopped.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There were plenty of bits in this chapter that I liked a whole lot more than this, but I had to use it. It doesn’t even have much to do with Lift… but it has everything to do with Nalan and what he’s doing. It’s worth noting that he doesn’t actually answer her question the first time; he merely gives his excuse: “In the name of justice.” Yes, he’s hunting “<em>in the name</em> of justice”—but he’s not hunting to <em>serve</em> justice. He’s hunting proto-Radiants, because he believes that what they do can bring the return of a Desolation. I could be wrong, but I think he <em>really believes</em> that.</p>
<p>Then again, I think he’s also quite, quite mad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>Lift is just way too much fun… although I suspect that if I had to be around her for any length of time, my attitude would be much more like Wyndle’s long-suffering restraint. I mean, aside from calling him Voidbringer all the time purely to annoy him, this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stealing regular stuff was no fun. She wanted a <em>real</em> challenge. Over the last two years, she’d picked the most difficult places to enter. Then she’d snuck in.</p>
<p>And eaten their dinners.</p></blockquote>
<p>Naturally. No point in stealing things you can sell and then buying food. Just steal the food in the first place. Oy.</p>
<p>Okay, she does have a point, actually; she breaks into rich people’s places because they have the best food, and then she eats their dinner—but it’s not like she’s taking anything irreplaceable, or even anything she has to worry about fencing carefully. Especially with the rich folk, she’s not even stealing anything they actually value.</p>
<p>Her interactions with Wyndle are generally hilarious—except that I keep getting irritated when she interrupts his lectures. <em>She</em> might not be interested in what he was going to say, but <em>we</em> are! <em>We</em> want to know how things work, but we just get hints, because she won’t let him finish a sentence. Silly girl. (Not that he was telling us anything we hadn’t already more or less figured out, but it was interesting to read his explanations nonetheless.)</p>
<p>After all that insouciance, it was unexpected to read something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Why did you even come with them?” Wyndle asked, creeping out of the room. “Why not just sneak in on your own?”</p>
<p>“Tigzikk found out about this whole election thing,” she said. “He told me tonight was a good night for sneaking. I owed it to him. Besides, I wanted to be here in case he got into trouble. I might need to help.”</p>
<p>“Why bother?”</p>
<p>Why indeed? “Someone has to care,” she said, starting down the hallway. “Too few people care, these days.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And this sequence, which in one way seems so out of character, and in another way perfectly <em>in</em> character:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lift safely reached the upper reaches of the palace, hidden in the shadows there. She squatted down, hands around her knees, feeling cold.</p>
<p>“You barely knew him,” Wyndle said. “Yet you mourn.”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“You’ve seen much death,” Wyndle said. “I know it. Aren’t you accustomed to it?”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Who would cry for Gawx? Nobody. He’d be forgotten, abandoned.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Why do you care?” Wyndle asked again. He sounded curious. Not a challenge. An attempt to understand.</p>
<p>“Because someone has to.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>She set Gawx on his back, face toward the sky. He <em>wasn’t</em> really anything to her, that was true. They’d barely just met, and he’d been a fool. She’d told him to go back.</p>
<p>But this was who she was, who she had to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then, at the end:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I <em>saved</em> him,” Lift said. “I did something good, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“Goodness is irrelevant,” Darkness said. His Shardblade dropped into his fingers.</p>
<p>“You don’t even care, do you?”</p>
<p>“No,” he said. “I don’t.”</p>
<p>“You should,” she said, exhausted. “You should… should try it, I mean. I wanted to be like you, once. Didn’t work out. Wasn’t… even like being alive…”</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite whatever her back-story might be—and it sounds horrific—she chose to care. She’s an Edgedancer by nature, I guess.</p>
<p>Also? I really, really want that back story. What is <em>with </em>Rall Elorim, anyway?</p>
<p>In other news, Azir has a most interesting way of choosing a new leader at the best of times. Everyone who’s interested fills out a bunch of paperwork and writes an essay, and the viziers choose the best one. At this worst of times, it’s downright bizarre, with everyone who “ought” to be a candidate doing their level best to be a lousy one. Gawx does have a fair point, though: it beats the bloody-succession-war method. Ironic, then, that he is chosen &#8212; as a result of being the only person to bleed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>The timeline isn’t specific on this one; it just says, “Before the Weeping,” which means it’s roughly concurrent, give or take a few weeks, with the main plot events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h4>
<p>Wyndle! Wyndle cracks me up. What a mismatch in personality between spren and human! Due to other recent thoughts on the subject, I specifically noticed his reactions to Lift’s continual references to him as “Voidbringer.” Aside from generally being offended (which is only natural) the tone of his objections really fits with the concept that the Voidbringers are a type of spren, rather than a race of physical beings.</p>
<p>Despite his claim to have holes in his memory due to the Realmatic transition, there’s a boatload of good information in Wyndle’s words. Just a few points:</p>
<p>• He did not choose his bond-mate; she was chosen for him by “the Ring,” presumably a group made up of the Edgedancer-bonding spren. Whether by agreement or because it’s not possible to disagree, he accepts the assignment.</p>
<p>• Lift was chosen because she had “visited the Old Magic” and “Our mother has blessed her.” This has <em>so</em> many possible implications, the most prominent being that Lift went to see the Nightwatcher and (corollary) the Nightwatcher is closely tied to Cultivation. This could be wrong, of course, but it does seem reasonable.</p>
<p>• It seems that Lift’s “boon” was the ability to gain Investiture directly from food… or was it the ability to see and touch things that are only in the Cognitive Realm? Or was it both? That would be unusual, wouldn’t it, to have two gifts from the Nightwatcher? And what was the curse? Or… is one the boon and one the curse? In which case… which is which?!</p>
<p>• In the Cognitive Realm, Wyndle appears like a vine which grows very quickly in whatever direction he wants to go, and sometimes forms a face through which he speaks to Lift. In the Physical Realm, the vine-trail he leaves behind hardens as if briefly becoming solid crystal, which people sometimes see—which sounds to me very like what Ym sees. As noted a few weeks back, Brandon will neither confirm nor deny this theory. (Here’s one case where I’m in disagreement with what I perceive as “most of the fandom”—I think Ym was a proto-Edgedancer, but most seem to think he was a Truthwatcher. Brandon <em>almost</em> promised that we’ll find out… or at least, that we’ll eventually find out for sure what kind of spren creates the effect Ym’s spren did. I suspect we’ll get it from someone who sees either Glys or Wyndle in the Physical Realm.)</p>
<p>• In the Cognitive Realm, he was apparently a master gardener, since “Cryptics and honorspren alike came to see the crystals I grew from the minds of your world.” The minor point is that, despite the political issues which make Cryptics and honorspren tend to not get along well (is that because they’re opposite each other on the circle of Surges/Orders?), they all admired his work. The major weirdity is the thought of growing crystals in the Cognitive world from the minds of those in the Physical world. How does that even work? (I’m afraid my mind just knocked all his pretty crystals down, flailing about to make sense of this.) Also: would the Edgedancer-spren be known as Gardeners, or is that just Wyndle? He notes that his choice of human would have been “an accomplished gardener” Iriali grandmother; again, is that his personal preference, or are all of his “type” gardeners of one sort or another? If they are, I’m betting that their non-sentient counterpart would be lifespren—which would also make sense for Edgedancers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>All Creatures Shelled and Feathered</strong></h4>
<p>The poor little larkin… I’m curious as to whether its forlorn appearance is due to its captivity in general—wings bound, and stuffed in a bag—or to the fact that they seem to have a means of preventing it from taking in Stormlight except when they want it to. Is it basically starving all the time, so that when it finds a source of Investiture, it will instinctively suck it all in no matter the consequences to anyone else? Or… How intelligent are these creatures, anyway?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ars Arcanum</strong></h4>
<p>So this is what an Edgedancer does—superslides, supergrowth, and superhealing. Well, this one, anyway… “Darkness” implies that she’s barely an amateur compared to the skills they once displayed, but with no one except a spren with holes in his memory to train her, I think that can be forgiven.</p>
<p>“Abrasion” (friction) is seen mostly in its absence; Lift makes herself frictionless to move quickly and to escape clutching hands. I can’t help wondering if there might be a connection between her climbing the walls with Wyndle forming hand- and foot-holds for her, and using friction to make herself “sticky” instead of “slick”… but we’re not given anything. In fact, Wyndle is seriously puzzled by her ability to touch him and actually use the grips he provides, so it doesn’t seem likely that the Edgedancers of old did anything quite like this.</p>
<p>“Progression” seems to be a relatively new skill, according to Wyndle’s lecture, but it certainly works well! I know a lot of people find it irritating that Lift should be able to make the seeds grow without knowing what to do, and even more so that she can heal Gawx with Regrowth. I have a few theories, though for anyone determined to be annoyed they won’t be enough. One is that some forms of Investiture seem to be more intuitive than others in this grand Cosmere, and Roshar seems a place where that’s the case. Another is that since Cultivation is still alive, and Progression is definitely Cultivation-linked, it may be even more intuitive than some Surges. A third is that with her odd connection to the Cognitive Realm, Lift has a unique ability to just <em>know</em> what to do. Your thoughts on the subject?</p>
<p>Oh, one more thing:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I will remember those who have been forgotten.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I notice that the Coppermind wiki identifies this as the second Ideal of the Edgedancers, but I’m questioning that, myself. Given how much she can already do at the beginning of the Interlude, it seems at least equally probable that this would be the third Ideal, and we just don’t yet know what the second one was. Anyone have a WoB stating that Lift has only said two of the Ideals? Because in lieu of that, I hold to the idea that this is more likely the third.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Vedeledev = Edgedancers and Nalan = Nalan. Need we say more?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Just Sayin’</strong></h4>
<p>Lift uses “stormin’” a few times, but her favorite cuss-word seems to be “starvin’.” Suitable, for a street waif who needs food not only for survival and the inevitable teen growth spurts, but who needs extra food because she turns too much of it straight into Investiture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kadasixes and Stars!&#8221;—a very Azish turn of phrase; <em>Kadasix</em> apparently translates as <em>Herald</em>.</p>
<p>Y&#8217;all can have a nice debate over whether &#8220;May he lead in wisdom. If he ever stops drooling&#8221; refers to &#8220;Yaezir, Herald of Kings&#8221; or &#8220;Gawx, Aqasix of Azir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when we join Szeth for some contemplation atop Urithiru. Well, <em>this</em> should be cheerful.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 58: Never Again</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Kaladin, Sadeas<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>The Shattered Plains<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Spears, Nalan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Dalinar and Elhokar argue about Kaladin; Kaladin says stupid things that prove he’s way out of his depth; he gets yelled at by Elhokar for it; Dalinar and Elhokar argue some more; Elhokar stomps out; Kaladin says more stupid things; he gets yelled at by Dalinar for it; Sadeas wigs out about the close call he just had, and begins making plans to get rid of Dalinar before Dalinar can get rid of him; Kaladin goes to prison and says yet more stupid things; Syl does not yell at him for it.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>“You’re going to let the king put me in prison.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Dalinar said, rising. “Elhokar has a temper. Once he cools down, I’ll get you free. For now, it might be best if you had some time to think.”</p>
<p>“They’ll have a tough time forcing me to go to prison,” Kaladin said softly.</p>
<p>“Have you even been listening?” Dalinar suddenly roared.</p>
<p>Kaladin sat back, eyes widening, as Dalinar leaned down, red-faced, taking Kaladin by the shoulders as if to shake him. “Have you not <em>felt</em> what is coming? Have you not seen how this kingdom squabbles? We don’t have time for this! We don’t have time for games! Stop being a child, and start being a <em>soldier</em>! You’ll go to prison, and you’ll go happily. That’s an order. Do you <em>listen</em> to orders anymore?”</p>
<p>“I…” Kaladin found himself stammering.</p>
<p>Dalinar stood up, rubbing his hands on his temples. “I thought we had Sadeas cornered, there. I thought maybe we’d be able to cut his feet out from under him and save this kingdom. Now I don’t know what to do.” He turned and walked to the door. “Thank you for saving my sons.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, blast it all anyway. If it weren’t for Kaladin stepping in, Adolin would never have survived this duel to challenge Sadeas. And if it weren’t for Kaladin stepping in, Sadeas could have been pinned down to an immediate duel. Dalinar is caught between gratitude and fury, and I certainly don’t blame him for giving Kaladin a well-deserved dressing-down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Commentary</strong></h3>
<p>Well. For all I’ve come to the defense of both Kaladin and Elhokar many times in the past, today I’d dearly like to grab them each by an ear and smash their heads together. Really <em>hard</em>. Yes, I understand where each of them is coming from, but what a pair of <em>tools</em>!</p>
<p>Elhokar doesn’t seem to comprehend, even after all these years, that kingship is not about getting to be the biggest bully on the playground – it’s supposed to involve leadership, self-discipline, even self-sacrifice; whatever it takes to do what’s best for your country. He seems to think that because he’s king, he gets to tell everyone what to do ‘<em>cause he da boss-man</em>; everyone is supposed to bow to his every whim. He has no concept at all of putting the needs of his people ahead of his own impulsive desires.</p>
<p>Elhokar should not <em>ever</em> have let his temper control him so that he lost the opportunity to tie Sadeas down on the duel. As noted last week, he could have perfectly well ignored Kaladin (or told him to wait) while he dealt with Adolin’s boon first. But he didn’t, so now he’s threatening to execute the man who saved the lives of his cousins just moments earlier. There was a time when he was an unwitting tool for those who used him for their own advancement and wealth. That’s not quite as likely to happen anymore, but his current disposition isn’t much better: now he’s a tool for his own emotions, and he doesn’t even realize how stupid it is to make major decisions solely on the basis of how he feels about it at the moment.</p>
<p>Speaking of being “a tool for his own emotions”… Kaladin is just as bad. He did this amazing thing by using the powers he gains from his bond with Syl, and then threw it all away on a perceived opportunity to further his own personal grudge against Amaram. <em>Tool</em>.</p>
<p>While we all appreciate that Amaram is a scuzzbucket, a murderer, and a thief, Kaladin was incredibly egocentric in thinking that he had every right to <em>expect</em> the same reward as Adolin, and (worse) in forgetting that boons are granted, not demanded. I’m not sure, at the moment, whether he’s been so wrapped up in his own issues all along that he wasn’t paying attention, that he didn’t recognize the overriding importance of getting Sadeas off Dalinar’s back. It’s possible; he’s been focusing on protecting/leading the bridgemen, guarding the Kholin family members, and becoming a Windrunner. Maybe he <em>wasn’t</em> paying attention to what Dalinar was trying to accomplish, and subconsciously regarded it as lighteyed politics. That’s not much of an excuse, though; Syl has been going nuts about the red-eyed spren, and there’s the whole Assassin in White thing going down, to say nothing of the countdown scribbles. These are events of world-shaping import, and if he doesn’t realize the significance of removing a major threat to Dalinar’s ability to deal with them, he’s been paying attention to the wrong things.</p>
<p>*sigh* Yes, I understand why Kaladin did what he did. I even understand why Elhokar did what he did. But both of them were being extraordinarily short-sighted and self-centered, and they both bear the blame for ruining the plan. What’s really sick-making is that by all rights, given the loophole in the wording, Adolin shouldn’t even have survived to make the challenge; when he won, astonishingly, against all the odds&#8230; these two clowns threw it away.</p>
<p>I never thought I’d say this, but at the moment I’m more angry at Kaladin and Elhokar than I am at Sadeas and Amaram. S &amp; A are foul and slimy by nature, so of course they do foul and slimy deeds, and justify them according to their respective foul and slimy ideologies. Kaladin and (at least in my head) Elhokar are <em>supposed</em> to be part of Team Light, but their combined selfishness just did a bang-up job of stabbing Dalinar in the back.</p>
<p>With friends like that, who needs enemies?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h3>
<p>Same day, obviously. There are twenty-eight short days left in the countdown, as Dalinar knows all too well – and as Elhokar and Kaladin also know, but seem to have <em>somehow forgotten</em> while they&#8217;re busy being petty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h3>
<p>The only spren in this chapter is a very subdued Sylphrena. Last time we saw her, she was spinning with joy as the judge awarded the day to Brightlord Adolin. In her one appearance today, she finally drifts into the room after Kaladin is locked in prison, and he appears to blame <em>her</em> for the events of the day. I can’t call it the <em>beginning</em> of their downward spiral, but it’s certainly a mile-post on the way to the nether regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h3>
<p>Nalan, Nalan. Judge. Herald of Justice. There seems to be a bad case of “poor judgement” going around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Words of Radiants</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p><em>So Melishi retired to his tent, and resolved to destroy the Voidbringers upon the next day, but that night did present a different stratagem, related to the unique abilities of the Bondsmiths; and being hurried, he could make no specific account of his process; it was related to the very nature of the Heralds and their divine duties, an attribute the Bondsmiths alone could address.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">—From <em>Words of Radiance</em>, chapter 30, page 18</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Shallan and Jasnah are correct and the Parshendi themselves are the Voidbringers, this would be interpreted as Melishi figuring out a way to bring down an entire race. I begin to suspect that the real Voidbringers are instead those spren which place Listeners in the forms which enslave them to Odium. In that case, perhaps his connection to the Stormfather, combined with the way the Listeners need a highstorm to transform, gave him some way to control <em>which</em> spren could form bonds. Maybe? I’m sure there are a thousand theories. Let’s hear them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welp. Thus endeth Part Three: The grand finale of Adolin’s dueling spree has fizzled, and Kaladin is grumping in prison. On the bright side, next week we can leave Kaladin to his grumping while we dodge over to the other side of the continent to begin the third set of Interludes. Lift!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 57: To Kill the Wind</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Shallan, Kaladin<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>the Dueling Arena<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Spears, Jezrien</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> a full disadvantaged duel is fought; a full disadvantaged duel is won; a full disadvantaged duel is wasted.</em></p>
<p>What, you want details? This time you really should read the chapter; trying to recap it is futile.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, I’ll give it a shot:</p>
<p><em>Kaladin comes to Adolin’s aid, and there are lots of nifty moves and cool Surgebinding, and Pattern comes out to play, and what with Adolin’s awesome fighting and Kaladin’s awesome Windrunning and a super-cool Lastclap, they win. Then Kaladin throws it all away. </em></p>
<p>Is that better?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>He sped up, then lunged between two of the Shardbearers, ramming his spear into Relis’s cracked vambrace. The man let out a shout of pain and Kaladin pulled his spear back, twisting between the attackers and getting close to Adolin. The young man in blue armor glanced at him, then quickly turned to put his back toward Kaladin.</p>
<p>Kaladin put his own back toward Adolin, preventing either of them from being attacked from behind.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here, bridgeboy?” Adolin hissed from within his helmet.</p>
<p>“Playing one of the ten fools.”</p>
<p>Adolin grunted. “Welcome to the party.”</p>
<p>“I won’t be able to get through their armor,” Kaladin said. “You’ll need to crack it for me.” Nearby, Relis shook his arm, cursing. The tip of Kaladin’s spear had blood on it. Not much, unfortunately.</p>
<p>“Just keep one of them distracted from me,” Adolin said. “I can handle two.”</p>
<p>“I— All right.” It was probably the best plan.</p>
<p>“Keep an eye on my brother, if you can,” Adolin said. “If things go sour for these three, they might decide to use him as leverage against us.”</p>
<p>“Done,” Kaladin said, then pulled away and jumped to the side&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I know. Even with the Rule of Awesome in play, Suspension of Disbelief stretches mighty thin here. The idea that Relis, Elit, and Jakamav would be so surprised by Kaladin’s entrance that they’d just stop swinging for 15-20 seconds, allowing Adolin and Kaladin to have this little tete-a-tete (dos-a-dos?), is patently absurd. I love it anyway.</p>
<p>The thing is, for all their suspicions, dislikes, and grudging-respects of the past, for all Kaladin’s questions about trust on the way in, Adolin responds with instantaneous trust and cooperation. It gets me every time I read it, and I just toss my disbelief to the wind and <em>enjoy</em> it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>What a crazy chapter. Nothing like rising to the heights and plunging to the depths all in one fell swoop, is there?</p>
<p>I have to laugh at Kaladin’s plan: assuming that he’ll be the one to take down their opponents, if Adolin can just crack their Plate open for him. Ummm… really? If he could do that on command, he’d already have won. The biggest thing in favor of Kaladin’s approach—at least if you’re trying not to cripple anyone during a war—is that if a weapon is going to get through their Plate, at least Kaladin’s would only cause normal damage. That’s a good thing…?</p>
<p>I would now proceed to laugh at Adolin’s arrogance in thinking that, even with all the damage to his own Plate, he can still handle two of the best duelists in Alethkar on his own… except that he actually <em>can</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The prince fought desperately against his two opponents, swinging his Blade back and forth between the men on either side of him. And <em>storms</em> he was good. Kaladin had never seen this level of skill from Adolin on the practice grounds— nothing there had ever challenged him this much. Adolin moved between sweeps of his Blade, deflecting the Shardblade of the one in green, then warding away the one with the hammer.</p>
<p>He frequently came within inches of striking his opponents. Two-on-one against Adolin actually seemed an even match.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find myself in the odd position of not caring <em>in the slightest</em> whether it’s realistic for a duelist to be so good he can actually hold off two opponents. I just love that it’s Adolin, the one who wanted nothing more than to be a duelist but refrained from dueling because of the Codes, the one who has trained and trained on the practice grounds and on the battlefield, the one who has no Surgebinding or Stormlight assists, the one who looks like a spoiled rich kid when he’s actually a highly disciplined soldier—it’s Adolin, assisted only by his own skill and stamina, who <em>really can</em> hold his own against two opponents.</p>
<p>If this had gone the way he planned, as a 2-on-1 duel, he’d have mopped the floor with them; it was only the <em>fourth</em> opponent who actually damaged his Plate in the previous chapter. Even now, having taken multiple hits so that his Plate is leaking Stormlight from nearly every piece, he manages to damage one opponent badly enough that Kaladin can “finish him off” (destroying his breastplate) with just a spear, batter another into yielding, and get a wrestling grip on the third just before his Plate locks up. (Snicker. Jakamav, this moment of ignominy couldn’t possibly happen to a more deserving <span style="text-decoration: line-through">guy</span> jerk.)</p>
<p>Yup, our boys are amazing. Adolin is a stunning duelist, and Kaladin is a Stormlight-enhanced maniac. I suppose in a way you can’t blame Relis, the sneaking coward, for running off to “fight” Renarin. I can’t help thinking that dismissing his Blade was probably the best move Renarin could possibly have made here; even Relis hesitates to strike an unarmored and now unarmed man. That hesitation is just long enough to allow Kaladin to slide into place and do a Lastclap—and send both himself and Relis reeling from the screams of the trapped spren. (The foreshadowing… it hurts us, it does. Ow.)</p>
<p>And so we win! We win!</p>
<p>And once again, Kaladin blows it. Just like how many (?!) other times, he fails to think through the possible side effects, and causes terrible grief to his own side by his impulsive actions. All they went through in the last few minutes, all of Renarin’s imprudent bravery, all of Adolin’s beating, all of that Stormlight burned, and Kaladin can only see <em>his </em>opportunity to get <em>his</em> vengeance on <em>his</em> enemy, and he destroys their entire plan.</p>
<p>From the tension, to the awesome, to the victory… to the pits.</p>
<p><em>SANDERSOOOOOONNNNN!!!!!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h4>
<p>Pattern and Sylphrena are the only spren we spot in this chapter, and their roles, while minute, are really fun. Right at the beginning, Shallan sends Pattern to see if he can somehow interfere with Abrobadar as he fights/toys with Renarin, while Syl assures Kaladin that this time will be <em>very</em> different from last time he came to the rescue of a lighteyes fighting a Shardbearer. The next time we see either of them,</p>
<blockquote><p>On the other side of the arena, the fourth man—the one who had been “fighting” Renarin—was waving his sword at the ground for some reason. He looked up and saw how poorly things were going for his allies, then left Renarin and dashed across the arena floor.</p>
<p>“Wait,” Syl said. “What is that?” She zipped away toward Renarin…</p></blockquote>
<p>This makes me giggle helplessly every time I read it. Abrobadar standing there waving his sword at a bumpy shape on the ground is enough in itself, but Syl going “Hey, wait a minute!” and zipping off to investigate a Cryptic… Maybe it’s just because in the middle of all this tension I need some comic relief, but it makes me laugh.</p>
<p>The other breathtaking moment with Syl comes a little later, when Kaladin finds himself unexpectedly fighting two full Shardbearers, trying to buy Adolin a little more time:</p>
<blockquote><p>The wind began to blow around him. Syl returned to him, zipping through the air as a ribbon of light.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Wind. Motion. Kaladin fought two Shardbearers at once, knocking their Blades aside with the helm. He couldn’t attack—didn’t dare <em>try</em> to attack. He could only survive, and in this, the winds seemed to urge him.</p>
<p>Instinct . . . then something deeper . . . guided his steps. He danced between those Blades, cool air wrapping around him. And for a moment, he felt—impossibly—that he could have dodged just as well if his eyes had been closed.</p>
<p>The Shardbearers cursed, trying again and again. Kaladin heard the judge say something, but was too absorbed in the fight to pay attention. The crowd was growing louder. He leaped one attack, then stepped just to the side of another.</p>
<p>You could not kill the wind. You could not stop it. It was beyond the touch of men. It was infinite. . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Aaahhhhh! Fuel for the fires of windspren-make-Shardplate theories, though of course there’s not quite enough evidence to call it proof. It makes me wonder, though, whether the living version of Shardplate is any more… well, <em>solid</em> than a living Shardblade. In Dalinar’s “midnight essence” vision, the KR’s armor seemed extraordinarily mutable; is it possible that the real, living thing only ever <em>looks</em> like armor, but in reality is a constantly shifting, flexing, moving flow of <em>thought</em>?</p>
<p>(Also, did I just use “reality” in that question?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ars Arcanum</strong></h4>
<p>Windrunning FTW! For the first part of the fight, Kaladin seems to just <em>hold</em> the Stormlight rather than using it for Lashings or anything, but it seems to augment his natural skill (as I think we’ve noted before). Better balance, quicker responses, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Falling on Relis’s back with a multiple lashing, though… that was <em>outstanding</em>. It did severe damage to his Plate, and put him out of the fight for ten heartbeats plus the time it took him to recover from the fall. All of which served its purpose: keep someone occupied so Adolin has a fighting chance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Jezrien, patron Herald of the Windrunners, is fairly obvious here. Need we say more?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Words of Radiants</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p><em>Malchin was stymied, for though he was inferior to none in the arts of war, he was not suitable for the Lightweavers; he wished for his oaths to be elementary and straightforward, and yet their spren were liberal, as to our comprehension, in definitions pertaining to this matter; the process included speaking truths as an approach to a threshold of self-awareness that Malchin could never attain. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">—From <em>Words of Radiance</em>, chapter 12, page 12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an odd duck. Some people read this as Malchin having bonded to a Cryptic, but being unable to progress as a Lightweaver because of his inability to speak the further truths he would need in order to become as self-aware as the Cryptics demand. Others read it as someone who thought he could choose which Order he wanted to belong to, and being miffed by finding that the spren of that Order won’t take him because of his lack of self-awareness.</p>
<p>Thoughts? IMO, he doesn’t sound like much of a KR candidate anyway, but that’s probably just me being snooty tonight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Just Sayin’</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“What are you doing here, bridgeboy?”</p>
<p>“Playing one of the ten fools.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, indeedy. But it’s a good thing, all in all.</p>
<p>There are more things to discuss: Shallan’s self-flagellation for failing to see The Loophole; lots more about the actual fighting (what was your favorite moment?); Renarin; Brightlady Istow’s reluctance to call anything… Lots, lots more. Please join in! It’s been great to see all the new folk stepping in!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That ought to keep us busy until next week, when we have to deal with the aftermath of Kaladin’s interference.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 56: Whitespine Uncaged</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Kaladin, Adolin, Dalinar<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>The Dueling Arena<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Spears, Chach</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> the entire cast arrives at the dueling arena to watch the big event, with Amaram flaunting the Knight Radiant cloak; Syl pleads with Kaladin not to let Amaram ruin him; Moash is insubordinate. Adolin speaks briefly to his Blade, then joins Navani and Renarin; they discuss the terms of the match; he forgot Mother’s chain, but once arrayed in his Plate, Adolin walks out and awaits his opponents; there are FOUR of them. Dalinar is furious at the fast one Sadeas has pulled on them, but it’s all in the dueling conventions. Adolin agrees to the match, cursing himself for a fool; he hears Zahel’s voice giving him encouragement and advice; he moves to the attack, and it’s clear that all four opponents do indeed fear him; he fights incredibly well, but against four, he is soon bested; as they finally surround him, beating on his Plate and preventing him from signaling surrender, he realizes they intend to leave him dead or crippled. Dalinar asks to borrow Elhokar’s Blade, and Sadeas eggs him on; Elhokar shows unexpected insight in stopping him; Renarin steps into the arena. Relis makes it clear that Renarin will be killed if Adolin tries to surrender; the judge has clearly been Nobbled. She refuses to stop the fight; Renarin begins an epileptic seizure, while Adolin fights marvelously but hopelessly; Dalinar challenges the spectators to help, and turns to Amaram, who looks away like the rat he is; Kaladin takes a spear and jumps into the arena.</em></p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“They’re scared of you.” Zahel’s voice, drifting again above the crowd. “Do you see it in them? Show them <em>why</em>.”</p>
<p>Adolin hesitated. Relis stepped forward, making a Stonestance strike. Stonestance, to be immobile. Elit came in next, hammer held wardingly. They backed Adolin along the wall toward Abrobadar.</p>
<p>No. Adolin had demanded this duel. He had wanted it. He would not become a frightened rat.</p>
<p><em>Show them why</em>.</p>
<p>Adolin attacked. He leaped forward, sweeping with a barrage of strikes at Relis. Elit jumped away with a curse as he did so. They were like men with spears prodding at a whitespine.</p>
<p>And this whitespine was not yet caged.</p></blockquote>
<p>Every time I read it, this scene takes my breath away. As noted in the following paragraphs, it’s one against four, but it’s the <em>four</em> attracting the fearspren. If this were a duel without Shards, Adolin would have won; in the first few minutes Relis would have been dead and Elit maimed, with Adolin still untouched. But of course, they all have Plate, and so they recover. But it almost worked.</p>
<p>Also? The “Whitespine Uncaged” is totally, solely Adolin. There’s no one else <em>in</em> this fight. And he’s awesome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>I was actually planning to break with tradition and do two chapters this week, because when I was rereading, I couldn’t stop at the end of the chapter. I figured I’d just do the whole fight at once, because everyone will talk about the whole fight anyway, right? Except I changed my mind. There is a lot in this chapter to deal with, so I’m going to request right up front that we <em>try</em> to hold off on discussing the events of the next chapter until we get there. Give this chapter its due.</p>
<p>To start with, let’s just get Kaladin’s issues out of the way. Every time he sees Amaram, he loses control, to the point that Sylphrena is begging Kaladin not to let Amaram ruin him. Juxtaposed against that unreasoning<strong>*</strong> antipathy, Moash lets slip that he’s met with Graves &amp; Co. again, against Kaladin’s direct order, because he’s <em>so </em>confident that Kaladin will eventually agree that Elhokar ought to be removed. At this point, Kaladin is angry at Moash for that assumption, angrier that he disobeyed a direct order, disturbed by the implication that he just might refuse to obey further orders, and annoyed with himself for not having dealt with this already. I’m annoyed about that, too, because next time he considers the question, things will have changed. Considerably.</p>
<p><em>Sigh.</em></p>
<p>Back to Adolin. The conversation with Navani is unsettling in retrospect. Due to the terms of the duel—that it would go until surrender, rather than specifying a number of broken Plate sections—Navani can already see that they’re going to try to cripple Adolin… and in a few pages, that’s exactly what they attempt to do. When he realized that he forgot Mother’s chain, to my surprise that turned out to me more like a warning that something bigger was going to go wrong, rather than causing Adolin to be off balance. And four opponents was definitely “something bigger.”</p>
<p>I had completely forgotten that Brandon gives us the full explanation of the loophole here, with Sadeas’s tacit admission that he knew all about it, despite his claim to neutrality.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Two?” Sadeas asked. “When was it said that he would fight two?”</p>
<p>“That’s what he said when he set up the duel!” Dalinar shouted. “Paired disadvantaged duel, two against one, as per the dueling conventions!”</p>
<p>“Actually,” Sadeas replied, “that is <em>not</em> what young Adolin agreed to. Why, I have it on very good authority that he told Prince Relis: ‘I’ll fight you and whomever you bring.’ I don’t hear a specification of a number in there— which subjects Adolin to a <em>full</em> disadvantaged duel, not a paired duel. Relis may bring as many as he wishes. I know several scribes who recorded Adolin’s precise words, and I hear the highjudge asked him <em>specifically</em> if he understood what he was doing, and he said that he did.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s all “I heard” and “they say” but he knows too much about it. I’m convinced that he was involved in putting it together. He was probably the one who bought the judge, too. (Speaking of which, it seems apparent that she had the authority to call the duel any time she chose—for example, if she thought that one of the participants was in danger of injury beyond the bounds of appropriate dueling risk. Like what was happening here. She wasn’t required to stop it according to the conventions, but she could have. She didn’t.)</p>
<p>Back to Sadeas and his probable involvement, he digs in later with that whole “The Blackthorn I once knew” garbage, trying to inflame Dalinar to the point that he’ll just jump in and go for it. That was probably his goal all along. Which brings up one of the rare times Elhokar does anything to show that he has the makings of a king, however well buried he keeps such hints on a normal basis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Elhokar caught him by the arm, standing. “Don’t be a fool, Uncle. Listen to him! Do you see what he’s doing? He obviously <em>wants</em> you to go down and fight.”</p>
<p>Dalinar turned to meet the king’s eyes. Pale green. Like his father’s.</p>
<p>“Uncle,” Elhokar said, grip tightening on his arm, “<em>listen</em> to me for once. Be a little paranoid. Why would Sadeas want you down there? It’s so that an ‘accident’ can occur! He wants you <em>removed</em>, Dalinar. I guarantee that if you step onto those sands, all four will attack you straight out. Shardblade or none, you’ll be dead before you get into stance.”</p>
<p>Dalinar puffed in and out. Elhokar was right. Storm him, but he was right.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of those rare times that almost seem to justify Dalinar’s confidence in Elhokar&#8217;s ability to be a good king.</p>
<p>About the duel itself, it’s amazing. Four against one, and Adolin actually holds his own for a time. Once they manage to surround him, of course, it should be all over; he acknowledges it and tries to yield, and the cremlings refuse to allow that. They’re going to either kill or cripple him, and they’re all four—including his “friend” Jakamav—in on this. The judge is clearly not going to intervene until it’s just too late to prevent some “accidentally” crippling blow. And then Renarin steps in.</p>
<p>That boy. I’ve got nothing but admiration for him, no matter how he feels about his performance. A Blade that screams every time he summons it, no time to put his Plate on, but he walks out there to give whatever aid he can, even if it’s only to distract one of the “duelists” and give Adolin half a chance. I know there are a lot of people who find Renarin grating (including Shallan), but I have a lot of respect for him.</p>
<p>Of course, this brings up the moment of honesty from Relis, wherein he flatly states that this duel is not about honor. He’s out to punish Adolin—presumably for embarrassing his cousin?—and makes it quite clear that if Adolin doesn’t stay out here for the beatdown that will obviously end with him maimed or dead, Renarin will receive that fate instead. Coward. In spite of all his haughty words, he clearly knew that he couldn’t beat Adolin in a fair fight. He had to get two of the best duelists in the country to help him, even though he was supposed to be the dueling champion himself. (As backhanded compliments go, that&#8217;s a doozy!) He’s a coward and a bully, and I will love to see it rebound on his head next week.</p>
<p>As for Jakamav… As the old saying goes, with friends like that, who needs enemies? Better yet, the old rejoinder: with friends like that, who needs friends? Wimp. Political convenience overcomes conscience.</p>
<p>Finally, as Adolin’s Plate begins to lose pieces, leaving him vulnerable to the Blades, this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dalinar turned upon the stands full of spectating lighteyes. “You can watch this?” he shouted at them. “My sons fight alone! There are Shardbearers among you. Is there not one of you who will fight with them?”</p>
<p>He scanned the crowd. The king was looking at his feet. Amaram. What of Amaram? Dalinar found him seated near the king. Dalinar met the man’s eyes.</p>
<p>Amaram looked away.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some &#8220;Knight Radiant&#8221; you are, dude. You couldn’t even <em>begin</em> to be a true Radiant.</p>
<p>It’s really set up so that there’s no good solution for the Kholins—it looks like at least one of them is going to die, no matter what they do, and even the king can’t stop it. Honor is dead.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong> “Unreason<em>ing</em>” does not mean “unreason<em>able</em>,” for the record. There’s plenty of reason for Kaladin’s attitude, but when he sees Amaram, he stops reasoning altogether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>The day after the menagerie date. Twenty-eight days remain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Haven’t We Met Somewhere Before?</strong></h4>
<p>Well, of course we know who Zahel is, and we’ve met before. It’s not exactly a major issue, but until I can get to that Warbreaker reread, can anyone tell me how Zahel is making his voice audible to Adolin in the midst of all the shouting and clashing? I can’t remember. I love that he’s doing it, though, and that he’s trained Adolin well enough that with so few words, Adolin can sort out a whole new strategy in a matter of seconds. <em>They’re afraid of you. Show them why.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Chach watches over this chapter alone, and I can think of half a dozen reasons. I just wish I knew which was the right one. Kaladin is in his role as Guard. Adolin is also Guard, in one sense, as well as being Brave and (again in one sense) Obedient. Chach is so often associated with chapters which focus on Adolin, if it weren’t for that Edgedancer Blade I want him to restore, I’d still insist he’s destined to be a Dustbringer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Words of Radiants</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p><em>Twenty-three cohorts followed behind, that came from the contributions of the King of Makabakam, for though the bond between man and spren was at times inexplicable, the ability for bonded spren to manifest in our world rather than their own grew stronger through the course of the oaths given. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">—From Words of Radiance, chapter 35, page 9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that’s a mouthful. I’m not entirely sure what the cohorts from the King of Makabakam have to do with anything, but there are two significant truths stated here: (1) the bond between man and spren is at times inexplicable; (2) bonded spren increase in their ability to manifest in the Physical Realm as the Knight-in-training progresses through their Ideals. The second is primarily a confirmation of what we already suspected. The first, though… the first is a 2&#215;4 reminder that we really don’t have anything resembling solid knowledge about what triggers a bonding and what its development will necessarily look like for any of our budding Radiants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Just Sayin’</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>In total, he had forty men on duty.</p>
<p>None of them would be worth a drop of rain if the Assassin in White attacked.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when we’ll finish off this duel. You know, one way or another…</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 55: The Rules of the Game</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Kaladin<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>The Warcamps &amp; Outer Market<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Spears, Joker, Shalash</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Kaladin sets himself to accompany Adolin and Shallan on their date, to Adolin’s exasperation; the carriage driver is—“You!” and Kaladin joins him cautiously; Wit and Kaladin trade smart remarks, in an exchange which Kaladin clearly loses; Wit drops a hint that he knows about Kaladin’s Surgebinding; as they arrive to pick up Shallan, Adolin discovers that the carriage driver is—“You!” and is suspicious; Shallan emerges and realizes that the extra man standing there is—“You!” and hugs him; Kaladin rides in the carriage with Adolin and Shallan, with a running internal monologue about the superficiality of lighteyes; Shallan gives Adolin the details of the dueling scheme she’s developed; it becomes clear that it might well work, but only because it’s such a </em>lighteyed<em> sort of game; they visit a menagerie in the Outer Market, where Shallan is fascinated, Adolin puzzled, and Kaladin bored; Kaladin admits to Syl that he’s almost ready; Dalinar arrives, and makes an announcement that sets Kaladin back to zero.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“It’s just a duel,” Kaladin said. “A game.”</p>
<p>“This would be different,” Adolin said.</p>
<p>“I don’t see why. Sure, you might win his Shards, but his title and authority would be the same.”</p>
<p>“It’s about perception,” Shallan said. “Sadeas has formed a coalition against the king. That implies he is stronger than the king. Losing to the king’s champion would deflate that.”</p>
<p>“But it’s all just games,” Kaladin said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Adolin said— Kaladin hadn’t expected him to agree. “But it’s a game that Sadeas is playing. They are rules he’s accepted.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>The chapter starts out on a rather sour note. Kaladin has decided to take Teft’s questions about Shallan seriously, and given the possibility that she could be an assassin, he’ll do the guarding himself. He is, however, extremely grumpy, and seems determined to take out his acid mood on Adolin. Lovely way to start a date.</p>
<p>Of course, everything goes a bit wonky when the carriage driver shows up. Heh.</p>
<p>This line really jumped out at me this time around: “Something just felt <em>off</em> about this Shallan Davar.” Adolin keeps saying exactly the same thing about Kaladin… which may well be one of the best reasons to suspect that he <em>will</em> become a KR of some description.</p>
<p>The central discussion, of course, is the scheme to get Sadeas into the dueling arena. Interestingly enough, when Shallan brings up the subject of the duel, Adolin assures her that it’s okay to talk about it in front of Kaladin; since he’s saved Adolin’s life twice and attends all the secret meetings, there’s no point in being coy. It’s also crystal clear that at this point, Adolin is expecting a two-on-one duel. He fully expects to win it, too.</p>
<p>It’s delicious (and deliberate) irony that the plan is actually a direct copy of something Sadeas did many years ago, but that it’s not something he can see coming, because the only set-up it needs is a spectacular win. It’s good to note that, although Shallan and Adolin fully believe it can work, and even convince Kaladin of the same, Shallan still insists that Navani and Dalinar need to examine the idea and approve it. As we’ll see later, they will do so—and neither of them caught the loophole in Adolin’s challenge either. But we’ll talk about that next week.</p>
<p>You know the worst part of this chapter? Things are starting to get better: Kaladin concludes that Shallan isn’t an assassin, the three of them almost behave like human beings to one another, Shallan has a great time sketching the menagerie, and Kaladin cheers up by thinking about flying. So much so, in fact, that he’s just about ready to (I think this is what they meant) tell Dalinar about becoming a Windrunner. Things are right on the brink of a big step up… and then at the very end of the chapter, Dalinar and Amaram show up and make an announcement that destroys it all.</p>
<p>Amaram, the wretch, doesn’t have a clue what the ancient oaths actually <em>mean</em>. Or if he does, he doesn’t care if he’s forsworn on the spot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>This chapter takes place the day after the Elit duel and Shallan’s meeting with the Ghostbloods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>All Creatures Shelled and Feathered</strong></h4>
<p>Quite the assortment of critters in today’s line-up!</p>
<p>Sarpenthyn—“little more than a lump of flesh with two bulbous eyes and four long tentacles.” Kaladin and Adolin both think it’s about the ugliest thing ever, but Shallan is wide-eyed and thrilled. She reaches in and grabs one of the tentacles to see if it’s warm or cold, and starts sketching, disgusted at the lack of scholarship when the identification plaque calls it “Devil rock captured in Marabethia. The locals claim it is the reborn vengeful spirit of a child who was murdered.”</p>
<p>Skyeels—Not a lot of information here, but we have all the sketches from TWoK for them.</p>
<p>“Some kind of chull-thing”—A rather uninformative grunt from Kaladin, who thinks it should be perfectly happy in its cage, where it’s at least safe from predators. Syl feels sorry for it.</p>
<p>The Colorful Chicken—presumably a parrot, it has “red, blue, and green feathers. She dug out colored pencils to do that sketch. Apparently, she’d missed a chance at sketching one of these a long time ago.” Nice little shout-out to the “Middlefest” flashback, the same day as the talk which earned Wit that enthusiastic and unexpected hug.</p>
<p>Whitespine—This one is the most interesting, all around. “The square face showed sharpened mandibles— like teeth, only somehow more vicious— and a pair of long, toothlike tusks that pointed down from the upper jaw. The stark spikes running from the head along the sinuous back, along with powerful legs, were clues as to what this beast was.” This particular specimen seems too small and apathetic to justify the stories, but both Kaladin and Adolin have seen what they can do to a human body, when in the wild. Shallan comments that “They don’t do well in captivity. This one probably would have gone dormant in crystal long ago, if it had been allowed. They must keep dousing it to wash away the shell.”</p>
<p>Someone who is more of a biologist than I am should talk about this. Just the concept sounds cool to me: something that goes dormant in crystal when it can’t move enough, but can be kept from doing so by dumping water on it.</p>
<p>And <em>just because I can</em>, I shall add another beast to this list:</p>
<p>Amaram—parading around in a bright yellow-gold cloak with the double eye of the Knights Radiant emblem in black on the back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Haven’t We Met Somewhere Before?</strong></h4>
<p>“You!”</p>
<p>Yep, Hoid is back in town, as annoying as ever. I found it highly amusing that for all the arguments about Kaladin being a better match for Shallan than Adolin because he’s more witty, he could barely figure out what Wit was saying half the time. Not that this stops Kaladin from sourly thinking that <em>Adolin</em> isn’t very good at cracking jokes to amuse his betrothed; humility is not one of Kaladin’s strong suits.</p>
<p>Hoid is just as fun as ever, or more so, but you have to go read the conversations to get the enjoyment. There’s no way I can adequately summarize it here! (Seriously, go read it again. Hoot.) However, there are a few details brought up in his exchanges that I want to highlight.</p>
<p>IIRC, we’ve had some other hints that Wit’s flute—which Kaladin forgot about when they left Sadeas’s bridge barracks—is perhaps more than an ordinary flute. Certainly, we have a WoB that Sadeas had it, and that Wit <em>really</em> wants it back. Where it is now… well, it could be in Urithiru, or it could be at the warcamps if it got left behind with unimportant stuff.</p>
<p>Wit drops a hint—and scares the living daylights out of Kaladin—that he knows about Kaladin’s Surgebinding. “I wouldn’t want you to go flying off on me.” Kaladin picks up the hint, obviously, but can’t figure out what to do with it. After a bit of verbal sparring, he asks what Wit wants of him; the answer sets up a scene several chapters downstream, where Kaladin tells him a story…</p>
<p>There’s also this lovely little tidbit:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m a soldier, not a musician,” Kaladin said. “Besides, music is for women.”</p>
<p>“All people are musicians,” Wit countered. “The question is whether or not they share their songs. As for music being feminine, it’s interesting that the woman who wrote that treatise—the one you all practically <em>worship</em> in Alethkar—decided that all of the feminine tasks involve sitting around having fun while all the masculine ones involve finding someone to stick a spear in you. Telling, eh?”</p></blockquote>
<p>First, I love the observation that “All people are musicians; the question is whether or not they share their songs.” That’s downright profound, it is. As for the tradition of men’s vs. women’s arts… while it’s possible that Wit is just yanking Kaladin’s chain for the fun of it, I think this is for real, at least within a range of interpretation. It’s at least a highly diverting interpretation, and quite possibly an insight into the past politics of Vorinism.</p>
<p>The second-best thing about this whole scene with Hoid is the way everyone looks at him and exclaims, “You!” Especially the first time you read it, it’s hilarious.</p>
<p>The first-best thing, though, is everyone’s reactions to Shallan’s reaction:</p>
<blockquote><p>She suddenly started, eyes widening. She pointed at Wit with her freehand.</p>
<p>“You!” Shallan exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. People certainly are good at identifying me today. Perhaps I need to wear—”</p>
<p>Wit cut off as Shallan lunged at him. Kaladin dropped to the ground, reaching for his side knife, then hesitated as Shallan grabbed Wit in an embrace, her head against his chest, her eyes squeezed shut.</p>
<p>Kaladin took his hand off his knife, raising an eyebrow at Wit, who looked completely flabbergasted. He stood with his arms at his sides, as if he didn’t know what to do with them.</p>
<p>“I always wanted to say thank you,” Shallan whispered. “I never had a chance.”</p>
<p>Adolin cleared his throat. Finally, Shallan released Wit and looked at the prince.</p>
<p>“You hugged Wit,” Adolin said.</p>
<p>“Is that his name?” Shallan asked.</p>
<p>“One of them,” Wit said, apparently still unsettled. “There are too many to count, really. Granted, most of them are related to one form of curse or another. . . .”</p>
<p>“You hugged <em>Wit</em>,” Adolin said.</p>
<p>Shallan blushed. “Was that improper?”</p>
<p>“It’s not about propriety,” Adolin said. “It’s about common sense. Hugging him is like hugging a whitespine or, or a pile of nails or something. I mean it’s Wit. You’re not supposed to <em>like</em> him.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I can never quite decide whether I think it’s funnier that Wit doesn’t know what to do, or that Adolin compares Shallan’s action to hugging a whitespine. Either way, that whole scene just delights me to the bottom of my socks.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Hands off.”</p>
<p>“She’s far too young for me, child,” Wit said.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” Adolin said with a nod. “Stick to women your own age.”</p>
<p>Wit grinned. “Well, that might be a little harder. I think there’s only one of those around these parts, and she and I never did get along.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I believe that to be an unmistakable reference to the holder of the Shard Cultivation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Another chapter where the Herald icons are fairly transparent: the Joker is <em>always</em> there when Wit plays a large role, and Shalash can variously be associated with Wit’s Lightweaving, Shallan’s Lightweaving, or Shallan herself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Words of Radiants</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p><em>The considerable abilities of the Skybreakers for making such amounted to an almost divine skill, for which no specific Surge or spren grants capacity, but however the order came to such an aptitude, the fact of it was real and acknowledged even by their rivals. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">—From <em>Words of Radiance</em>, chapter 28, page 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from the same page as the Chapter 54 epigraph, and sounds very much like it could be the following sentence. I could be wrong, of course, but I take this to mean that the unique ability of the Skybreakers is the capacity to accurately determine guilt and innocence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Shipping Wars</strong></h4>
<p>Okay, I laughed all the way through this chapter, with Shallan and Adolin all flirty and Kaladin all sour and cranky. I seem to remember thinking on my first read that Shallan was trying too hard again, and I kept expecting it to rebound on her. Luckily, subjects of real interest turn up before it gets too nauseating.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I thought this the first time through or not, but even worse than Shallan’s overplaying her role, Kaladin was being an absolute toad. Inwardly or outwardly, his antipathy toward lighteyes was <em>way</em> more annoying than Shallan’s somewhat obvious flirting. He’s so bad that not only does Syl accuse him of being so sour she can practically taste it, he even has to admit to himself that he</p>
<blockquote><p>“wasn’t giving those two enough credit. They might ignore him, but they weren’t actively <em>mean</em> to him. They were happy and pleasant. Why did that annoy him so?”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m clearly starting to get paranoid and read too much into things these days, because that phrasing—“Why did that annoy him so?”—seems to carry <em>hints</em>. Hints of what, I don’t know for sure. Self-awareness? Attraction? Interference by Odium-spren? I shall choose to settle on the idea that Kaladin is finally starting to recognize his own unfair prejudice against others merely because they are lighteyes. That interpretation at least has the benefit of leading up to his choices in the upcoming chapters and his change in attitude toward Adolin, if not lighteyes in general.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Just Sayin’</strong></h4>
<p>Favorite line of the whole chapter:</p>
<blockquote><p>If she was some kind of con woman, she wasn’t after Adolin’s life. Just his dignity.</p>
<p><em>Too late</em>, Kaladin thought, watching Adolin sit back with a stupid grin on his face. <em>That’s dead and burned already.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Aside from the way this makes me giggle like a teenager, I did note the phrase “dead and burned” as opposed to our “dead and buried.” On Roshar, or at least in Alethkar, if you weren’t important enough to be Soulcast into stone when you died, your body would be burned, not buried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when… when… when… Oh, my peeps, it’s <em>coming</em>. Next week: <em>Whitespine Uncaged</em>.<strong><em> The. Big. Duel.</em></strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 54: Veil’s Lesson</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>the Unclaimed Hills<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Pattern, Shalash, Ishar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Shallan walks through the rain in the Unclaimed Hills to meet with several members of the Ghostbloods; Mraize is surprised that “Tyn and Shallan” were able to enter Amaram’s house and is impressed by the pictures she provides; Shallan has carefully chosen which bits of information are actually revealed by the pictures, but inadvertently reveals that she can draw very accurately from memory; Mraize realizes that Shallan killed Tyn and is working on her own, and commends her for it; as she is dismissed, she realizes that in his parting words, Mraize has given the others tacit permission to try to kill her; in a slight panic, she creates an Illusion of a boulder and hides in it, while sending Pattern to use her voice to tell the carriage driver to return to the warcamp; hoofbeats follow and then return; Mraize speaks to an unidentified companion of various other persons interested in these matters; when her Illusion dissipates, she begins the long walk back to the warcamp while practicing accents with Pattern; their practice is disrupted by the discovery of her carriage burned, her coachman and his parshmen murdered; she continues her walk more somberly, pondering how she could have handled this so no one died.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“We will need to find how much he knows.” Mraize’s voice. “You will bring these pages to Master Thaidakar. We are close, but so—it appears—are Restares’s cronies.”</p>
<p>The response came in a rasping voice. Shallan couldn’t make it out.</p>
<p>“No, I’m not worried about that one. The old fool sows chaos, but does not reach for the power offered by opportunity. He hides in his insignificant city, listening to its songs, thinking he plays in world events. He has no idea. His is not the position of the hunter. This creature in Tukar, however, is different. I’m not convinced he is human. If he is, he’s certainly not of the local species.…”</p></blockquote>
<p>Thaidakar, Restares, Taravangian… So far, Mraize seems to know more about all these subversive groups than anyone else, but Gavilar apparently knew <em>something</em> about a couple of them, at least. (Too bad he didn’t pass that information on.) And what about “this creature in Tukar,” while we’re at it? I’m guessing—only guessing—that he’s referring to “that god-priest of theirs, Tezim.” What creates the legend of a god-priest on Roshar? An Unmade? Someone holding an Honorblade? A Surgebinder/Proto-Radiant? A rogue Herald?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>The juxtaposition of this chapter with the previous hits me almost as hard as the interweaving of the Lightweaving/Windrunning chapter did a couple of weeks ago. Last week’s title of “Perfection” was both literal and ironic, as Adolin was perfectly in control of the duel, but (as we know to our dread) not so perfectly in control of his wording when he challenged Relis. This week, Shallan’s planning and presentation was nearly flawless, but the whole thing almost unraveled by a few thoughtless words.</p>
<p>I must also note that this week’s title, “Veil’s Lesson,” brings back memories of another Lesson, one in which people also woke up dead. This time, though, instead of criminals springing the trap Jasnah set for them and paying the ultimate price, the innocent driver and porters were killed by the trap Shallan accidentally dropped them into.</p>
<p>I had all sorts of snarky comments in my head about Shallan learning that she was out of her league; that when you play games with the Ghostbloods, the stakes are high; that if you’re not careful, the innocent pay the price on your behalf. Then it hit me: she learned those lessons a long time ago. This is indeed a grim reminder, and this time she has some knowledge of what the stakes <em>are</em>, but she’s been caught in this kind of game since she was a little girl… and the innocent <em>always</em> seem to pay the price. From Li’l Shallan nearly murdered for the beliefs of her mother and her “friends,” to the destruction of her own innocence in self-defense, to the burden of protection which drove her father into madness, to the servants maimed as an outlet for his anger at her… and all of it tangled up with Ghostbloods, Skybreakers, and possibly other subversive organizations or fanatic cults. No, high stakes and lives on the line are not a new experience for her. The difference is that this time, she’s deliberately taking an active role, and is therefore more directly to blame when the innocent are murdered. And she knows it.</p>
<p>Still, she did acquit herself well for the most part. I was impressed that she replaced all the writing with appropriate but uninformative wiggly lines, and that she only gave him a small chunk of actual text which <em>might</em> serve to get him talking. I was more impressed that she had her story worked out so that the reasons for the missing information was perfectly plausible. If only she hadn’t admitted that she could draw so well from memory; it was a slight, understandable, but deadly error.</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, she was bound to make some mistakes. At least this one wasn’t life threatening. Probably.</p></blockquote>
<p>Foreshadowing, much? Ouch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>This is the same day as Chapter 53, and the reason Shallan had to refuse Adolin’s dinner invitation. Thirty days remain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>All Creatures Shelled and Feathered</strong></h4>
<p>The general wild beauty of the surroundings form an idyllic backdrop to what turns out to be a vicious, deep, and twisty narrative. Shallan has so much fun, initially, enjoying a walk in the rain and observing the thirst-emboldened grass and the proliferating vines. She gives herself a little biology review as she strolls along, and compares the vegetation to what she’d be likely to find at home in Jah Keved. And then… the politicking starts, and we don’t get to enjoy the vines any more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ars Arcanum</strong></h4>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5">Pictures! Pretty pictures! </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WoR_SKETCHBOOK-VEIL_fmt.jpg?fit=0%2C%209999&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-189113" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WoR_SKETCHBOOK-VEIL_fmt.jpg?fit=600%2C%209999&#038;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C893px" alt="WoR_SKETCHBOOK-VEIL_fmt" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5">I </span><em style="line-height: 1.5">love</em><span style="line-height: 1.5"> the way she describes (according to “Brightness Axeface”) and sketches a lady’s pace, including the angles of the feet—and then proceeds to draw Veil walking in a very different manner. As she would, of course. Interestingly, Shallan has a thought that I suspect may come into play again later:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>It occurred to her that this person she became when she put on the hat and dark hair was not an imitation of someone else, not a different person. It was just a version of Shallan herself.</p></blockquote>
<p>For some reason, I can’t help thinking along with her that this could be dangerous.</p>
<p>Aside from Shallan’s always-amazing artwork, and the clever use of the boulder she had put into the picture she drew for Mraize, there is another lovely little exchange I must point out:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What I need to do,” Shallan said, “is train you to speak along with my images.”</p>
<p>“You should have them speak themselves,” Pattern said.</p>
<p>“Can I do that?”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Because… well, I use Light for the illusion, and so they create an imitation of light. Makes sense. I don’t use sound to make them, though.”</p>
<p>“This is a Surge,” Pattern said. “Sound is a part of it. Mmm… Cousins of one another. Very similar. It can be done.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“Mmmm. Somehow.”</p>
<p>“You’re very helpful.”</p>
<p>“I am glad…” He trailed off. “Lie?”</p>
<p>“Yup.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, I’ll admit it: I included the last five lines for the sheer fun of it. The earlier part, though, is the first clear indication we’ve had (unless you read the Ars Arcanum first) that Illumination uses more than just <em>light</em> to do its thing; control of this Surge confers the ability to manipulate other waveforms, too. So if she can figure out how to do it, she should be able to include sound in her Illusions. I’ll have to watch for this; right now, I can’t recall whether she succeeds in this book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Haven’t We Met Somewhere Before?</strong></h4>
<p>We’ve been given to understand that Mraize is Thaylen, but IIRC he’s also been confirmed as a world-hopper. This really makes me wonder about his involvement in Rosharan affairs. Has he returned because things started heating up? Did he trigger the heating? Or is he only tangentially interested in Roshar as it affects the Cosmere in general?</p>
<p>Speaking of world-hoppers, I have to confirm something that we discussed before: Iyatil, whoever she may be, is definitely <em>not</em> Khriss. I still don’t have any good guesses on who she <em>is</em>, but this much I know: Khriss is <em>tall</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>The Heralds this week are Shalash and Ishar. Shalash is fairly obvious, with her connection to Shallan’s Lightweaving. What about Ishar? I can’t help thinking he’s there for Mraize, but whether as the Vorin ideals of pious/guiding, the opposite, or the “associated madness” I can’t even begin to guess. There is so much about Mraize and the Ghostbloods that we just don’t know… *sigh*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Words of Radiants</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>There came also sixteen of the order of Windrunners, and with them a considerable number of squires, and finding in that place the Skybreakers dividing the innocent from the guilty, there ensued a great debate.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">–From <em>Words of Radiance</em>, chapter 28, page 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well. There seems to be some divisiveness among the Knights Radiant. Part of me really wants to know what the occasion was and what their various reasonings were, but I suspect this epigraph is mostly here to give us (a) hints of a conflict between orders; (b) Windrunners with squires; and (c) a peek into what the Skybreakers were all about. All three of those may well play critical roles in upcoming books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when Adolin and Shallan—with a reluctant Kaladin in tow—visit a menagerie for a change of pace. See you in the comments!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 53: Perfection</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Adolin<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>the Shattered Plains Dueling Arena<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Duelist, Battar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Adolin duels Elit using a new technique, very precise and calculated; Elit’s Plate completely seizes up for lack of Stormlight to repair it, Adolin is pronounced the victor, and the crowd is annoyed—all of which pleases Adolin tremendously; Shallan comes to congratulate him, and Navani promptly leaves; Shallan and Adolin begin to make dinner plans, but are interrupted by the arrival of Relis in a foul temper; Adolin had expected this and finally goads Relis into a duel by offering all his family’s Shards against those of Relis and whoever he brings with him; it promises to be spectacular.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“Fight me!” Elit shouted from within his helm.</p>
<p>“I have.” Adolin replied quietly. “And I’ve won.”</p>
<p>Elit lurched forward. Adolin backed up. To the boos of the crowd, he waited until Elit locked up completely— his Plate out of Stormlight. The dozens of small cracks Adolin had put in the man’s armor had finally added up.</p>
<p>Then, Adolin strolled forward, placed a hand against Elit’s chest, and shoved him over. He crashed to the ground.</p>
<p>Adolin looked up at Brightlady Istow, highjudge.</p>
<p>“Judgment,” the highjudge said with a sigh, “again goes to Adolin Kholin. The victor. Elit Ruthar forfeits his Plate.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Heh. Poor Istow. She keeps having to judge in Adolin’s favor, even when she doesn’t want to. (I don’t feel the least bit sorry for her, frankly.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>Yet another fighting style from Adolin. The first duel was a beat-down, then second one he carefully kept very close, and in this one he deliberately wore down Elit’s Plate until it seized up. It’s hard to comprehend how anyone can keep insisting that he’s lost his edge.</p>
<p>Then again, I guess <em>we</em> know that he’s doing it all on purpose, but all <em>they </em>see is that he’s being inconsistent—except for that nasty habit of winning everything.</p>
<p><em>::snicker, snicker::</em></p>
<p>One thing I found very interesting, particularly in light of recent discussions, was Adolin’s self-control in this duel. Despite the emotional backdrop, he is absolutely controlled—and controlling—as he executes exactly the duel he had planned.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ideal form. Each step in place. The Thrill rose within him, but he shoved it down. He was disgusted by the highprinces and their squabbling, but today he would not show them that fury. Instead, he’d show them <em>perfection</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Incidentally, that’s obviously the source of the chapter title.)</p>
<p>Adolin is frustrated, angry, disgusted, and generally cranky about both the Parshendi and the highprinces who oppose Dalinar, but instead of being controlled or driven by his emotions, he is calm, careful, serene, precise, quiet. (Yes, I got those all out of the text.) He planned exactly how he wanted it to go, and it went exactly as he planned. Because he’s just that good. And all that in spite of the fact that Elit was clearly trying to wound or kill him. Isn’t that sort of against the principles of dueling, by the way?</p>
<blockquote><p>Elit growled audibly from within his helm, then came in with another thrust. Right at Adolin’s faceplate.</p>
<p><em>Trying to kill me, are you?</em> Adolin thought, taking one hand from his Blade and raising it just under Elit’s oncoming Blade, letting it slide between his thumb and forefinger.</p>
<p>Elit’s Blade ground along Adolin’s hand as he lifted upward and to the right. It was a move that you could never perform without Plate— you’d end with your hand sliced in half if you tried that on a regular sword, worse if you tried it on a Shardblade.</p>
<p>With Plate, he easily guided the thrust up past his head, then swept in with his other hand, slamming his Blade against Elit’s side.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sweet. Reminds me a little of Dalinar’s lastclap; these guys are amazing. It must run in the family.</p>
<p>Adolin’s gambit pays off, since Relis comes storming in with his gaggle of lighteyes, all threats and bristles, and finally allows himself to be goaded into a duel. I’m definitely bothered by the fact that Brightlady Istow comes <em>with</em> him; even though she&#8217;s busy assuring Relis that Adolin didn&#8217;t break any rules, the fact that she’s in his company seems wrong to me. I suppose it’s partly combined with her attitude toward his first win, and knowledge of how she’ll behave in the upcoming one, but <em>storm</em> it, judges are supposed to be impartial!</p>
<p>I’ll always wonder – did Relis catch on right away about the loophole left when Adolin didn’t specify a number? I’m pretty sure Istow noticed it; did the others realize it as well, or did she give them the idea?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>This is the day after Kaladin’s and Shallan’s respective level-ups in Surgebinding; there are thirty days left in The Countdown.</p>
<p>Cue the ominous musics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Battar presides alone over this chapter. Patron Herald of the Elsecallers, she represents the attributes of Wise/Careful, which I assume is the reason she’s here. She is represented positively by Adolin’s careful, precise, perfect execution of the duel… and negatively by his failure to think carefully through the wording he used in his challenge to Relis:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you’re afraid,” Adolin said, looking back to Relis, “you don’t have to duel me alone.”</p>
<p>Relis stopped in place. He looked back. “Are you saying you’ll take me on with anyone else at the same time?”</p>
<p>“I am,” Adolin said. “I’ll fight you and whomever you bring, together.”</p>
<p>“You are a fool,” Relis breathed.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Relis stormed out. The others trailed after. The highjudge lingered, regarding Adolin. “You realize what you have done.”</p>
<p>“I know the dueling conventions quite well. Yes. I’m aware.”</p>
<p>She sighed, but nodded, walking out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, Adolin, that one little slip is going to hurt badly. On the other hand, some good things come of it, so we’ll forgive you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Words of Radiants</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p><em>As to the other orders that were inferior in this visiting of the far realm of spren, the Elsecallers were prodigiously benevolent, allowing others as auxiliary to their visits and interactions; though they did never relinquish their place as prime liaisons with the great ones of the spren; and the Lightweavers and Willshapers both also had an affinity to the same, though neither were the true masters of that realm. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">—From <em>Words of Radiance</em>, chapter 6, page 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve always taken this as evidence that both Transportation and Transformation give a reasonable affinity to Shadesmar, so that a Willshaper would be able to access it roughly as well as Shallan does; the combination of the two Surges, unique to the Elsecallers, grants true mastery. (Well… after a certain amount of practice, anyway. Heh.) It’s interesting to note that historically, the Elsecallers were known to graciously transport others—Knights Radiant only, or others as well?—to Shadesmar with them. Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Shipping Wars</strong></h4>
<p>I must point out how cute these two are:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shallan Davar burst in, wearing a violet dress, red hair flaring as she crossed the room. “That was incredible!”</p>
<p>“Shallan!” She wasn’t the person he’d been expecting— but he wasn’t unhappy to see her. “I checked your seat before the fight and you weren’t there.”</p>
<p>“I forgot to burn a prayer,” she said, “so I stopped to do so. I caught most of the fight, though.” She hesitated right before him, seeming awkward for a moment. Adolin shared that awkwardness. They had only been officially courting for little more than a week, but with the causal in place … what was their relationship?</p></blockquote>
<p>Aww. They’re just so perfect. Perfectly awkward, in this case, which is totally endearing. (Except I have trouble with a redhead in a violet dress. That doesn’t quite work for me. But maybe that’s just me. Redheads in the crowd? Does violet work for you?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey, y’all didn’t talk about the glyph-script Amaram was using last week. I started to, but then my electricity went out for three days due to a freak windstorm, and I had no internet. <em>*sigh*</em> Maybe I’ll throw it out there this week, if we need more discussion in the comments.</p>
<p>You. Have. Been. Warned.</p>
<p>So get into some discussion this week, and then join us again next week when Shallan tries her hand at gaining the confidence of the Ghostbloods. This should be rich.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 52: Into the Sky</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Kaladin, Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>The Warcamps, the Shattered Plains<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Spears, Jezrien, Shalash</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Kaladin wanders the edge between the chasms and the warcamps, musing, then steps into the chasm; Shallan, disguised first as a messenger boy and then as a maid, infiltrates Amaram’s manor; Kaladin attempts to alternate between running on the floor and running on the wall, but realizes he needs to work on the basics first; Shallan finesses a couple of close encounters and makes it to Amaram’s secret room, which turns out to contain maps; Kaladin discovers that his body fears falling even when his mind knows it’s safe; Shallan can’t take time to make sense out of the maps and glyph-writing, so she takes Memories of everything, then begins to draw frantically; Kaladin continues cautiously until he accidentally avoids a puddle with a reflexive Lashing, and sees how to change his perceptions; Shallan exits the house disguised first as Amaram, then as the messenger boy, and in giving Amaram the message which was her first alibi, she discovers that the Blade he bears is the one which had belonged to her brother Helaran; Kaladin improves dramatically and finally throws himself at the sky, surrounded by windspren; Shallan confirms that the man from whom Amaram obtained his Shards was indeed her brother, who is now certainly dead; as Kaladin returns to earth, he is dissuaded by Syl from going after Amaram right away, but on arriving in his room, he finds Shen waiting to say goodbye.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“It’s like when I first picked up a spear,” Kaladin whispered. “I was just a child. Were you with me back then? All that time ago?”</p>
<p>“No,” Syl said, “and yes.”</p>
<p>“It can’t be both.”</p>
<p>“It can. I knew I needed to find you. And the winds knew you. They led me to you.”</p>
<p>“So everything I’ve done,” Kaladin said. “My skill with the spear, the way I fight. That’s not me. It’s you.”</p>
<p>“It’s <em>us</em>.”</p>
<p>“It’s cheating. Unearned.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” Syl said. “You practice every day.”</p>
<p>“I have an advantage.”</p>
<p>“The advantage of talent,” Syl said. “When the master musician first picks up an instrument and finds music in it that nobody else can, is that cheating? Is that art unearned, just because she is naturally more skilled? Or is it genius?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“I’ll take it,” Kaladin said. “Whatever it is that gives me that edge. I’ll use it. I’ll need it to beat <em>him</em>.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Kaladin nodded, light wind ruffling his jacket as he fell through the night. “Syl…” How to broach this? “I can’t fight him without a Shardblade.”</p>
<p>She looked the other way, squeezing her arms together, hugging herself. Such human gestures.</p>
<p>“I’ve avoided the training with the Blades that Zahel offers,” Kaladin continued. “It’s hard to justify. I <em>need</em> to learn how to use one of those weapons.”</p>
<p>“They’re evil,” she said in a small voice.</p>
<p>“Because they’re symbols of the knights’ broken oaths,” Kaladin said. “But where did they come from in the first place? How were they forged?”</p>
<p>Syl didn’t answer.</p>
<p>“Can a new one be forged? One that doesn’t bear the stain of broken promises?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>She didn’t reply.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know, I know. That’s <em>way</em> too long for QOTW. But it’s all so important! Not that it answers any questions for us, at this stage. Syl <em>was</em> with him back then, but she also kinda <em>wasn’t</em>. His skill with the spear is somehow a joint effect—which explains some things that happen later, perhaps. And she <em>knows</em> how a new Blade can be forged… she just can’t <em>tell</em>. <em>::sigh::</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>This was a crazy chapter, as it alternates between short clips of Kaladin and Shallan on their different missions. Each is honing their Radiant skills, making use of them, working toward a specific goal. The juxtaposition was fascinating to follow, though.</p>
<p>Kaladin is just beginning to seriously practice his Windrunning, and this night is one of intentional training to confront Szeth when he returns. Shallan has obviously <em>been</em> practicing her Lightweaving, and can now prepare multiple disguises ahead of time, switching between them as needed; her goal, for tonight, is to infiltrate Amaram’s manor on behalf of the Ghostbloods—a mission that was assigned clear back in Chapter 43, which seems like years ago!</p>
<p>Kaladin works and works on the basics, until he finally does something different by instinct—and suddenly, it all comes clear, and the Lashings become natural. I find it highly amusing that the breakthrough comes when he instinctively avoids falling in a puddle again. There’s a glorious sense of thrill and triumph, as he finally, finally, <em>really</em> becomes a Windrunner. There’s a feeling that everything is going to come right, now, and that he and Syl are going to get this figured out. There’s such a joy in his new skill… and then it descends into anger and self-justification as he returns to earth, with his bitterness toward Amaram and shielding Moash. It turns foreboding, too, as Shen prepares to depart, gives Kaladin his real name of Rlain, and is clearly apprehensive about where he’s going. His statement, “The winds are not what I fear,” gives me the shudders.</p>
<p>Shallan, meanwhile, has her own series of successes, through much greater danger; her sequence of disguise and misdirection achieves the immediate goal of obtaining access to Amaram’s secret room, which is a triumph in itself, but she has to work very quickly to get everything in Memory, and then pull off another masquerade to cover her tracks and keep anyone from getting suspicious. There’s a feeling of elation, as she manipulates the cook into not mentioning her presence to Amaram and exits the manor. There’s a feeling of relief as she slips back into the messenger disguise and is in the right place for Amaram to find her. There’s a nice little resolution as she delivers her message about “her mistress” wanting to document Amaram’s Shards… and then it descends into horror and grief as she discovers that his Blade is the one once held by her beloved brother Helaran. Amaram’s blithe description of the “assassin” and his own “counterattack” which killed the young man is all too sickeningly vivid, and all her accomplishments of the night are buried in the sorrow of knowing that her brother is truly dead.</p>
<p>Parallel stories, indeed, and tied together at the end by Amaram’s role in each of their sufferings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>This is the same day as the previous chapter, in which Adolin had the ill-fated meeting with Eshonai. Thirty-one days remain in the countdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h4>
<p>The windspren! The windspren! I can’t wait to find out if the theory about windspren coming together to form Plate is correct… In any case, the behavior of the windspren here certainly foreshadows their behavior in the climax.</p>
<blockquote><p>…Syl zipped along to his right.</p>
<p>And to his left? No, those were other windspren. He’d accumulated dozens of them, flying around him as ribbons of light. He could pick out Syl. He didn’t know how; she didn’t look different, but he could tell. Like you could pick a family member out of a crowd just by their walk.</p>
<p>Syl and her cousins twisted around him in a spiral of light, free and loose, but with a hint of coordination.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A hundred windspren broke around him, like the crash of a wave, spraying outward from Kaladin in a fan of light.</p>
<p>He grinned. Then he looked upward, toward the sky.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is this “hint of coordination,” hmmm? Will they, or won’t they? I think they will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ars Arcanum</strong></h4>
<p>We already talked about this to some extent, but I want to look at a few more details. One thing that bugged me on my first reading only just became clear tonight—while washing dishes, of course. Shallan couldn’t take the time to actually study the maps and the glyphs, so she took Memories of them. Once finished with that, she slaps a piece of paper on the desk and starts drawing frantically—but she’d just thought that she’d do all the drawing when she was safely back in her rooms. Why was she drawing?</p>
<p>…Well, duh. She hadn’t planned to disguise herself as Amaram, so she needed to draw him in order to make sure the cook didn’t bring up any of this again, especially to Telesh. Not sure why it took me so long to figure that out!</p>
<p>Other than that, I enjoyed seeing the skills she’s been practicing: multiple disguises which she can switch off, combined with a few physical props that simply make it easier; working with Pattern to provide different voices when necessary; and of course Pattern’s ability to unlock things. Good stuff, and extremely useful!</p>
<p>About Kaladin’s practice, I can certainly see Kaladin doing things exactly the way he did, including “hopping onto and off the wall a couple hundred times.” If it were me, though, I’d practice it in my own room, leaning against a wall and just shifting the direction of &#8220;down&#8221; over and over. Standing on the floor, then lying on the wall, then standing on the floor… all without moving. But then, I’m lazy and my method wouldn&#8217;t be nearly as cinematic. And it wouldn’t provide the opportunity to fall out of a puddle. Heh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>For once I feel safe in saying that these are totally obvious. Kaladin and Shallan are each actively practicing their Radiant skills, and so the Heralds associated with their Orders naturally watch over the chapter: Jezrien, for the Windrunner, and Shalash, for the Lightweaver. “Into the Sky” hardly needs clarification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Words of Radiants</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p><em>Now, as the Truthwatchers were esoteric in nature, their order being formed entirely of those who never spoke or wrote of what they did, in this lies frustration for those who would see their exceeding secrecy from the outside; they were not naturally inclined to explanation; and in the case of Corberon’s disagreements, their silence was not a sign of an exceeding abundance of disdain, but rather an exceeding abundance of tact. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">—From <em>Words of Radiance</em>, chapter 11, page 6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the only mention of the Truthwatchers in the entire book until we reach Chapter 89, where Renarin reveals himself as a Truthwatcher. (And yes, I still think his claim is valid.) When we first read this epigraph, then, we had no idea of what Truthwatchers might do, and this gave us no further clue. Basically, they didn’t tell anyone what they did? Helpful. I have to wonder, though: what good is it to see the future if you never tell anyone else what you see? Or did they, as an Order, pool their information, decide what needed to be done about it, and tell the other Orders whatever they felt was necessary?</p>
<p>In any case, Renarin seems set to change that secrecy, at least among the small circle of known Radiants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Just Sayin’</strong></h4>
<p>Totally irrelevant to the origin of this unit, but it strikes me as the perfect placement. As much time as I spent with Team Sanderson last weekend, we spent oddly little time talking about the books. One question I did ask Brandon, though, was whether Ym was an Edgedancer. We both acknowledged that with the healing thing, he had to be either an Edgedancer or a Truthwatcher, of course. He pointed out that Ym’s spren doesn’t look at all like Wyndle, which I countered by saying that I thought the Ym’s spren manifested the way Wyndle would if you couldn’t see the Cognitive Realm. He just smiled… and said something like, “I’m going to RAFO that. You’re very wise, and I put the description in for a reason, but I’m going to RAFO for now.”</p>
<p>Which means… nothing, really. “You’re very wise” can very well mean, “That was good logic, and would make sense if that’s what I was doing, but I wasn’t.” It can also mean, “You figured it out, but I don’t want to confirm it just yet.” Or… something else. Anyway, it’s still a RAFO. I guess we’ll just have to watch for manifestations of Glys; maybe we can see what he looks like by comparison. I find that I’m hoping it doesn’t mean we’ll see Ym again, because the only way I see that happening is if Nalan is going around only-mostly-killing Radiants and then bringing them back to life… and that just doesn’t sound like a good thing at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well. That was a <em>long</em> chapter, and I didn’t even get to the discussion of Amaram and the stormwarden glyph-writing, which is important in light of the past few weeks’ discussion. So we’ll hit that in the comments, which ought to keep us busy until next week, when Adolin returns to the dueling arena for more fun and games.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 51: Heirs</h3>
<p><strong>Point of View:</strong> Adolin<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>the Shattered Plains<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Duelist, Chach, Ishar</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Adolin makes Decisions; an Expotition is Planned; Adolin wins an Argument; as a result, he rides out on his father’s horse, wearing his brother’s armor; he and his escort meet Eshonai and her escort, with uneasiness on both sides; Adolin takes a scribe with him to speak with Eshonai between the two groups; pretending to be Dalinar, he opens by suggesting that they discuss her surrender; she seems much different than last time they met, and no longer wishes to parley; she tells him that there will be peace when one side is dead; Adolin returns to the warcamp to find Dalinar already planning a different, much larger Expotition—one which will take the battle to the Parshendi and an ending. </em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“Father!” Adolin snapped. “This is <em>not</em> subject to discussion!”</p>
<p>The room fell silent. Dalinar lowered his hand from the map. Adolin stuck out his jaw, meeting his father’s eyes. Storms, it was difficult to deny Dalinar Kholin. Did his father realize the presence he had, the way he moved people about by sheer force of expectation?</p>
<p>Nobody contradicted him. Dalinar did what he wanted. Fortunately, these days those motives had a noble purpose. But in many ways he was the same man he had been twenty years ago, when he’d conquered a kingdom. He was the Blackthorn, and he got what he wanted.</p>
<p>Except today.</p></blockquote>
<p>This rather gives me the shivers. Especially followed, as it is, by Adolin’s argument that the kingdom cannot survive without Dalinar. Anyone else, but not Dalinar, with his visions and his leadership. Dalinar is <em>correct</em> in saying that the kingdom should be able to stand the loss of any one man, but Adolin is <em>right</em> when he points out that Alethkar is just not there yet. And Adolin, supported by Kaladin, wins the debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>First of all, greetings from Sasquan, the 73<sup>rd</sup> World Science Fiction Convention! I’m here, and if you’re here, please find me!! (I’ll be at Registration all morning, every morning… except I’m hoping to duck out early on Friday for the Writing Excuses podcast. I will also be at as many of Brandon’s events as I can swing.)</p>
<p>Now back to our regularly scheduled programming, which today involves some heavy-duty foreboding. There’s a perky bit at the beginning, when Adolin has made his decision not to worry about Dalinar’s “disconcerting behavior” during highstorms; since it’s all a package deal, and he’s already concluded that his father’s sanity is just fine, there’s really nothing else to do, and so he pragmatically moves past it.</p>
<p>From there, it goes steadily downhill. The worry about the assassin’s return is always hovering; the worry about Dalinar’s survival is stepped up by the emphasis on how much they need him; everything feels weird about Adolin’s departure to me, but to him it centers around the difference between riding his father’s Ryshadium and his own.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gallant was a large black animal, bulkier and squatter than Sureblood, Adolin’s horse. Gallant looked like a warhorse even when compared to other Ryshadium. So far as Adolin knew, no man had ever ridden him but Dalinar. Ryshadium were finicky that way. It had taken a lengthy explanation from Dalinar to even get the horse to allow Adolin to hold the reins, let alone climb into the saddle.</p>
<p>It had eventually worked, but Adolin wouldn’t dare ride Gallant into battle; he was pretty sure the beast would throw him off and run away, looking to protect Dalinar. It did feel odd climbing on a horse that wasn’t Sureblood. He kept expecting Gallant to move differently than he did, turn his head at the wrong times. When Adolin patted his neck, the horse’s mane felt off to him in ways he couldn’t explain. He and his Ryshadium were more than simply rider and horse, and he found himself oddly melancholy to be out on a ride without Sureblood.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m… not even going to say any more about that. It makes me very sad.</p>
<p>Then things get even more ominous, as Eshonai pretty much repudiates everything she had said earlier to set up this meeting, and further states that it will be over when one side is dead, because they’ve just changed the rules. As Adolin tries to get more understanding of the situation, there’s this:</p>
<blockquote><p>“King Gavilar,” Eshonai said, as if mulling over the name. “He should not have revealed his plans to us that night. Poor fool. He did not know. He bragged, thinking we would welcome the return of our gods.”</p></blockquote>
<p><em>What was Gavilar planning? And how much did he unleash without their knowledge?</em></p>
<p>These are my burning questions, and I don’t know how many books we’ll have to wait to get the answers.</p>
<p>Perhaps most chilling of all, when Adolin finally reaches the warcamp after this abortive negotiation, Dalinar is well into a plan to assault the Parshendi—too well into it for this to be a new idea. He’s clearly been working on it for some time, and now that they have the negative response from Eshonai, he’s working out the details with his generals. There’s going to be a real war soon, and it’s going to put them out in the middle of the Shattered Plains just as the countdown finishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>Thirty-one days to go; this takes place on the day after the highstorm of the previous chapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>All Creatures Shelled and Feathered</strong></h4>
<p>Perhaps I should have held the quote about Sureblood and Gallant for this section, but it belonged up there. Here, I shall merely point out that the Ryshadium are definitely not mere horses. Aside from their stature, they’re connected with their riders in a way we clearly don’t understand yet. To quote Brandon (or paraphrase?), “Investiture is involved.” We just don’t know how.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>So here we stand with Chach and Ishar for a chapter that primarily involves Adolin and Dalinar. This combination was so frequent in <em>TWoK</em> that I was convinced Adolin would be a Dustbringer. For a more obvious association, though, once again Adolin is guarding his father and Dalinar is guiding his nation.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure what “Heirs” references; the word is not used in the chapter. On a guess, it may be Adolin as Dalinar’s heir (both literally, and in the sense of him taking Dalinar’s place in leading the Kholin armies) and Eshonai as being the heir of all that the Parshendi once were (in the worst possible way, now). Please discuss!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Words of Radiants</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p><em>In short, if any presume Kazilah to be innocent, you must look at the facts and deny them in their entirety; to say that the Radiants were destitute of integrity for this execution of one their own, one who had obviously fraternized with the unwholesome elements, indicates the most slothful of reasoning; for the enemy’s baleful influence demanded vigilance on all occasions, of war and of peace. </em></p>
<p>—From <em>Words of Radiance</em>, chapter 32, page 17</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well. That just raises a whole boatload of questions. Who was Kazilah? Who/what was he fraternizing with? Why did they execute him? How? We can only speculate, of course, but I find myself assuming that this is related to the “wicked thing of eminence” again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regard to things I didn’t address but should have… would someone go do all the research on Teleb and the Oldblood? There are several other worthy topics as well, but y’all will have to go read the chapter to dig them out.  I’m wiped.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, I won’t be joining in on the discussion until much later tonight; by the time this posts, I’ll be at my station over in the Convention Center, and the programming really picks up tomorrow. I hope I make it back in time to get some sleep…</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 50: Uncut Gems</h3>
<p><strong>Point of View:</strong> Adolin<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>the Storm Cellar, the Kholin complex<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>the Duelist, Palah</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Adolin waits out the highstorm in the men’s bunker of this Storm Cellar; he speaks briefly to Elit about their upcoming duel and is snarled at for his pains; Sadeas strolls over to taunt him, and it very nearly works; Adolin’s response earns the approval of his bridgeman guard; he wanders through the markets, idly considering the earlier events of the day and the future event of tomorrow’s meeting with the Parshendi; as he returns to the Kholin domicile, he finds the bridgemen-guards in a bit of a turmoil over a new set of glyphs scratched into the sitting-room floor; Dalinar assumes responsibility for them, presumably part of his vision-trance, and Navani seems to agree; the end date of the countdown is duly noted.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>Sadeas smiled again. “Do you think me an evil man, Adolin?”</p>
<p>“That’s too simple a term,” Adolin snapped. “You’re not just evil, you’re a selfish, crem-crusted eel who is trying to strangle this kingdom with his bulbous, bastard hand.”</p>
<p>“Eloquent,” Sadeas said. “You realize I <em>created</em> this kingdom.”</p>
<p>“You only helped my father and uncle.”</p>
<p>“Men who are both gone,” Sadeas said. “The Blackthorn is as dead as old Gavilar. Instead, two <em>idiots</em> rule this kingdom, and each one is—in a way—a shadow of a man I loved.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A selfish, crem-crusted eel. Nice one, Adolin. Very accurate as well as eloquent. Sadeas, how I love to hate you. Vile wretch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>Oh, hey, look! It’s an Adolin chapter! Hope you didn’t wear out the subject last week… (Seriously – that was amazing! I was gone on a mini-vacation with family and friends for three days, and I had major reading to do to catch up with y’all!)</p>
<p>This week we’re in Adolin’s head in the aftermath of his date with Shallan, and I have to revisit that subject very quickly. He’s very pleased that “this thing with Shallan” seems to be working, because she’s marvelous, exotic, witty, and not smothered in Alethi propriety. (Would that infer what we’d call “Victorian propriety” or “Alethi social expectations of behavior?” I suspect the latter. We can discuss the implications in the comments.) Also, he thinks that she’s smarter than he is but doesn’t make him feel stupid – and it’s implied that it’s rather an Alethi thing for the women to make sure the men <em>know</em> how much “smarter” they are.</p>
<p>I find myself deeply irritated by Vorin tradition. Adolin is not at all sure the betrothal will continue to work, since his relationships <em>always</em> work at first and fall apart later. Add to that the “she didn’t make him feel stupid” comment, and it makes me want to smack Alethi society at large. Any man who is reasonably intelligent but has a very limited education because “it’s not manly” would have to be very frustrated by all the well-educated women who confuse “uneducated” with “unintelligent” and correspondingly treat men like idiots. Even if it’s a subconscious irritation, it’s got to be there. (As a student of literature, I’m delighted with the relatively subtle inversion of expectations. As an observer of pop culture, it reminds me far too much of the typical sitcom and advertising trope where men are assumed to be stupid and incompetent, and only manage to survive by virtue of possessing an intelligent wife/girlfriend.<em> GRRR.)</em></p>
<p>So here sits Adolin. For once in his life, he’s had a conversation with a woman who assumes that he’s intelligent enough to understand what she’s talking about. Even when she was being witty at his expense, she invited him in to the fun rather than making him the butt of it for others. IMO he was complimented by both of those, and it’s probably the first time in his life that’s happened. No wonder his relationships never last beyond a week or two.</p>
<p>Okay, back to the chapter. It opens with Adolin tossing a mild taunt or two at Elit about the seven-day wait for their upcoming duel; this is followed almost immediately by Sadeas throwing a couple of veiled taunts at Adolin about his overt flouting of the king’s—and Dalinar’s—authority. For a minute I wondered why Sadeas’s taunting bothered me so much more than Adolin’s, and if I was just being biased, but I don’t think that’s it. Not all of it, anyway. Elit has a legitimate means of getting back at Adolin: they’re dueling in two more days, and it <em>was</em> Elit’s choice to set the uncommonly long delay in the timing. Sadeas, on the other hand, is goading Adolin deliberately, knowing perfectly well there’s <em>nothing</em> Adolin can do about it without both undermining Dalinar and getting himself in horrible trouble.</p>
<p>Speaking of which… foreshadowing again.</p>
<blockquote><p>A small part of him wished for Sadeas to provoke him, push away his inhibitions, drive him to do something stupid. Killing the man right here, right now, would likely earn Adolin an execution—or at least an exile. It might be worth either punishment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadeas does his unholy best to provoke: pointing out the uncut gemstones on his ring and his coat, gained by doing an unauthorized plateau run in open contempt of Dalinar’s orders; making smart remarks about his “former property” who are now patrolling the markets; renouncing Elhokar’s appointment of him as Highprince of Information – and clearly indicating that no one else will accept any similar appointments from Elhokar; sneering at both Dalinar and Elhokar; hinting that neither of them will survive when Sadeas makes his move; and outright telling Adolin that “you’ll understand and agree with me eventually.”</p>
<p>Adolin managed to keep himself under control. He refrained from doing any physical violence that could get him in trouble, but at the same time he made it eminently clear that he was opposed to Sadeas in every way. I’m still wondering which of those gained him Skar’s nod of respect.</p>
<p>I just have to toss in a couple of other odd notes. One is Adolin’s realization that there is a <em>parshman</em> among the bridgemen, wearing a guardsman uniform and holding a spear. It’s funny in context (since we know why “Shen” is there) and heartbreaking in another (since we know why Rlain is there). When he points it out to Dalinar, he’s all, “Yeah, it’s cool. I was curious what would happen.”</p>
<p>The other thing is one that was mentioned last week in the discussion: Adolin’s Blade. I have to just quote the whole passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Adolin summoned his Blade, then dismissed it, then summoned it again. A nervous habit. The white fog appeared—manifesting as little vines sprouting in the air—before <em>snapping</em> into the form of a Shardblade, which suddenly weighed down his hand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brandon has confirmed that the “little vines” are because the Blade was originally an Edgedancer’s spren. While this is the only time I can find that someone’s Blade-summoning is described in this much detail, I’m not yet convinced that the process itself is significantly different than anyone else’s. It’s generally described as mist coalescing into the silvery Blade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>True Stormwatch event in this chapter:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thirty-two days. Seek the center.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“Seek the center.” I like the way the two drivers for the upcoming expedition dovetail. Dalinar, the soldier &amp; highprince with the authority, is getting magically-delivered instructions to seek the center of the Shattered Plains. Shallan, the well-on-her-way magic user with the ability to find and operate the target, is getting instructions from research and old stories to search out the ancient city of Stormseat that used to be in the center of Natanatan. Sneaky.</p>
<p>Note, also, that Navani has counted out the countdown, and the end date is in the middle of the Weeping, rather than being the date of a highstorm as Dalinar hoped. It is also two days before the end of the year, and there just doesn’t seem to be any significance to the date at all. I guess she’ll just have to wait and see…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ars Arcanum</strong></h4>
<p>We don’t know it yet, of course, but we’re seeing extremely accurate Truthwatching from Renarin and Glys right here.</p>
<p>Does anyone still seriously believe that Dalinar did this without realizing it? I know Dalinar takes the blame here, though of course he doesn’t remember doing it. This is totally inconsistent with his previous experience in the visions, where he could remember everything that happened. As he says himself, this is an awkward way for him to get the information; if it’s coming to him from the Stormfather, why could it not be included in the visions? Why would it be sent to his subconscious for him to scratch it into the ground, or the wall? The most logical answer, despite his assumption, is that it’s <em>not</em> coming to him – and certainly not from the same source as the visions. Honor even told him, in so many words, that he wasn’t much good at seeing the future. Cultivation, on the other hand, <em>is</em>… and Truthwatchers are directly in the center of the Cultivation side of the circle.</p>
<p>But of course they don’t know about that stuff yet, so Renarin’s activity goes unnoticed, and Dalinar assumes the responsibility for it.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Palah is the Herald of the Truthwatchers. That is all.</p>
<p>Okay, it’s not <em>quite</em> all. Because Palah: Scholar, Learned/Giving, Truthwatchers, Emerald, Pulp, Wood/Plants/Moss, Hair is on this chapter arch twice. Once might be for Sadeas and his stinking uncut emerald gems, but the other <em>has</em> to be for Renarin the Truthwatcher. So say I.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Words of Radiants</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p><em>And now, if there was an uncut gem among the Radiants, it was the Willshapers; for though enterprising, they were erratic, and Invia wrote of them, “capricious, frustrating, unreliable,” as taking it for granted that others would agree; this may have been an intolerant view, as often Invia expressed, for this order was said to be most varied, inconsistent in temperament save for a general love of adventure, novelty, or oddity. </em></p>
<p>–From <em>Words of Radiance</em>, chapter 7, page 1</p>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Willshapers. We really don’t know much about them, do we? Their Surges are Transportation (motion, Realmatic transition) and Cohesion (strong axial interconnection); we <span style="text-decoration: line-through">know</span> guess a fair bit about the first one, but I’ve heard very little explanation of the second. In any case, they appear to be the adventurers – but they also are associated with the Builder (Kalak). I do suspect the epithets of “erratic, capricious, frustrating, and unreliable” are artifacts of people who really, really don’t understand what drives them as an Order.</p>
<p>(Just in case anyone cares, I’ve officially given up my expectation that Adolin would be a Willshaper, and now hope that he’ll become a real Edgedancer so he can awaken his Blade.)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4><strong>Shipping Wars</strong></h4>
<p>Wow, last week’s wars were really something! Carry on, carry on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Just Sayin’</strong></h4>
<p>“Shalashian temperament” as an excuse to renounce your post as Highprince of Information, eh? What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when Adolin ventures forth disguised as Dalinar to meet with Eshonai. This should be rich…</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 49: Watching the World Transform</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>The Storm Cellar!<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Pattern, Palah, Chach</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Shallan meets Adolin for their first date, and is wigged out to realize that they’re supposed to sit and drink and watch the highstorm’s approach; she is repeatedly dazzled by his smile, his hair, his smile, his cologne, his smile, his laugh, his eyes, his smile (yeah, a whole lot of dazzling going on up in here); her efforts to play the appropriate part in the courtship game are derailed by her innate curiosity; Adolin responds to her accidental candidness by also becoming more genuine; bodily functions and Shardplate make for an embarrassing mix; everything about the conversation goes askew; the possibility of chasmfiend ranching arises; Shallan takes the excuse to segue into her desire to get out onto the Shattered Plains; Adolin explains current affairs; the highstorm approaches, and Shallan finds herself mesmerized instead of terrified; they finally duck into shelter with a wasted six-second lead before the storm hits; Shallan retires to the women’s sitting room.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“Well,” Adolin said, “if you must know, an old adage on the battlefield teaches that it’s better to be embarrassed than dead. You can’t let anything draw your attention from fighting.”</p>
<p>“So…”</p>
<p>“So yes, I, Adolin Kholin—cousin to the king, heir to the Kholin princedom—have shat myself in my Shardplate. Three times, all on purpose.” He downed the rest of his wine. “You are a very strange woman.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yup, I still think it’s one of the funniest lines in all of fantasy literature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>This was such a fun chapter to read, and such a hard chapter to write about! The conversation between Adolin and Shallan, replete as it is with Shallan mentally drooling over Adolin’s smile, eyes, etc., is entertaining and delightful, and there are so many exchanges that I’d love to copy… but you can read the chapter for that.</p>
<p>Aside from the shipping, which was SO much fun, the thing I found most compelling in this chapter was a development in Adolin’s character. Prior to this, even though we’ve been in his head, we’ve mostly seen his <em>character</em> through the eyes of Kaladin and Dalinar. Having said that, I must admit it’s a very odd statement. But I stand by it; his POVs have primarily focused on either his father or a battle. While this shows us his love, and respect for Dalinar, and is a superb perspective for a battle/duel scene, there’s not a lot about his actual motivation. The primary exception is that we’ve seen from the inside that he is intensely loyal, particularly to his father and brother.</p>
<p>So far, we’ve been given the mostly-external perspective of Adolin as a self-confident, even arrogant, prince; a fighter and duelist preoccupied with fashionable appearances and social acceptability. He’s not one to follow the stupider versions of “vanity-before-sanity” fashions, but he has a good sense of style and he does the things appropriate to his station in Alethi society. Dalinar thinks of him with great affection, but considers him somewhat hot-headed and overly concerned with the opinions of others; Kaladin merely thinks him spoiled, arrogant, and shallow. In either case, we’re not shown a man of particular depth.</p>
<p>This chapter gave me a whole different perspective. Back in Chapter 37, we got a hint, with this reaction when he saw Shallan for the first time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gorgeous red hair. There wasn’t a <em>single</em> lock of black in it. A slender build, so different from the curvaceous Alethi. A silken blue dress, simple yet elegant. Pale skin—it almost had a Shin look to it—matched by light blue eyes. A slight dusting of freckles under the eyes, giving her an exotic cast.</p>
<p>The young woman seemed to glide through the room. Adolin twisted about, watching her pass. She was so <em>different</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here in this chapter, <em>everything</em> changes (except that it&#8217;s from someone else’s POV again). At the beginning of the chapter, both of them are trying to be “proper” about this courtship gig; the theme is repeated again and again: the fashion folio, oversized so as not to be mistaken for a woman’s book. References to things they’re “supposed to do.” Act refined, because Adolin will expect sophistication. Act poised, elegant. This winehouse is the latest fad. Courting advice: “get him to talk about himself.” “He looked at her, expectant.” “…feeling as if she were filling an expected role.” “…dutifully looking at him with widened eyes.” “He paused…” “…what she hoped was a breathy, adoring voice.” “He paused again. She was probably supposed to ask what happened next.”</p>
<p>And then it all breaks loose.</p>
<blockquote><p>“What if you need to poop?” she asked instead.</p></blockquote>
<p>BAHAHAHAHA! The funniest part is that he starts to answer the questions she was “supposed” to ask—the question they <em>always</em> ask—before it registers what she in fact said. And then he answers her: honestly, bluntly, if somewhat reluctantly, and admits right out loud that “not going the way it’s <strong>supposed</strong> to” is kind of refreshing.</p>
<p>In rereading now, I was struck with the realization that honestly, he probably didn’t care all <em>that</em> much about fashion, and fads, and all the social hoo-hah. He just did what was expected of him (even if it was getting boring), because he had nothing else of great interest to do, no particular desire to rebel, and not much to rebel against anyway. He created an appropriate persona that more or less fit his interests and was suitable for his station, and lived in that persona, acting the part, dutifully following the script… until Shallan came and knocked him sideways.</p>
<blockquote><p>“…Do you know how many times I’ve told that story about saving the plateau run?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you were quite brave.”</p>
<p>“Quite.”</p>
<p>“Though probably not as brave as the poor men who have to clean your armor.”</p>
<p>Adolin bellowed out a laugh. <strong>For the first time it seemed like something genuine—an emotion from him that wasn’t scripted or expected</strong>. He pounded his fist on the table, then waved for more wine, wiping a tear from his eye. The grin he gave her threatened to bring on another blush.</p></blockquote>
<p>Suddenly, they are in a <em>real</em> conversation. They talk about chasmfiends, and the possible result of the continued hunts; he outright acknowledges that he’s not as dense as he pretends to be. They talk about the Parshendi, and his dueling; she admits that she is terribly ignorant of the politics, because all the information she had from Jasnah was badly outdated. She asks him to tell her some of what is going on…</p>
<p>And he does. He tells her the whole story: Dalinar’s visions, the betrayal by Sadeas, their salvation by the bridge crew, his current quest to win as many Shardblades as possible through dueling. Letting it all out seems to lift a weight from him, and she finds herself wanting desperately to help him. Those paragraphs confirmed it: I am resolutely <em>on <strong>this</strong> ship</em>. They have each been bearing burdens, for their families and for the world, and they have been acting the parts given them. Finally, here in this unlikely betrothal, they have each discovered a fitting partner: they’ve found someone to laugh with, to relax with; someone with whom they can be open, honest, natural; someone who brings out the best in them.</p>
<p>I love this chapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>Heh. Literally: Stormwatch. This is the same day as Chapter 47, of course. But I shall take advantage of the Stormwatch header to quote something fascinating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The stormwall.</p>
<p>A huge sheet of water and debris blown before the storm. In places, it flashed with light from behind, revealing movement and shadows within. Like the skeleton of a hand when light illuminated the flesh, there was something <em>inside</em> this wall of destruction.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Life. Something <em>lived</em> inside that storm, something that no artist had ever drawn, no scholar had ever described.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll… just leave that there for you to consider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h4>
<p>In conjunction with the aforementioned stormwatching, “Windspren zipped in tiny rivers of light overhead.” Pattern is nowhere to be seen–even by Shallan—during their conversation, though she hears him humming as the storm approaches. What is <em>that</em> supposed to mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>All Creatures Shelled and Feathered</strong></h4>
<p>Greatshells ahoy! This was an intriguing excursion into the biology of local fauna. Shallan postulates that chasmfiends, rather than being hunted as they’d always been, are now being essentially harvested, resulting in a decrease in the overall population. Oddly, rather than suggesting that they should stop, she instead draws the conclusion that perhaps the greatshells could be raised like chulls, breeding them and harvesting the gemhearts in entire batches. Greatshell ranching FTW! Might have problems with poachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Palah and Chach preside over this chapter; the scholar and the guard—or learned/giving and brave/obedient. I’d like to hear your thoughts on their relevance here, because all I’ve got is Shallan going all biology-teacher on Adolin, and his bravery in battle—or perhaps that of his armorers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Words of Radiants</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p><em>These Lightweavers, by no coincidence, included many who pursued the arts; namely: writers, artists, musicians, painters, sculptors. Considering the order’s general temperament, the tales of their strange and varied mnemonic abilities may have been embellished.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">–From <em>Words of Radiance</em>, chapter 21, page 10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from the same page as the epigraph of Chapter 47. The tone of this one, combined with what we know of Shallan’s own “strange… mnemonic abilities,” makes me think that the narrator may not be completely unbiased. So maybe the mistrust of the Lightweavers I got from the previous epigraph is more appropriately directed at the writer of this book?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Shipping Wars</strong></h4>
<p>Shallan and Adolin! Uh… we pretty much talked about that already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Just Sayin’</strong></h4>
<p>This isn’t so much in-world phrasing, but in-world fashion. Believe it or not, it only <em>just now</em> occurred to me that the folio Adolin is examining gives us the visuals for the “Lift” interlude, which we’ll get to in…um… a couple of months or so. Okay, I’m slow sometimes.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WoR-Azir.jpg?fit=0%2C%209999&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-184909" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WoR-Azir.jpg?fit=600%2C%209999&#038;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C905px" alt="WoR Azir" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a lot in this chapter I didn’t address. Navani, the parshmen, Shallan’s drawings, the yu-nerig, thoughts on Jasnah and Tyn and Kabsal, the reactions of the Alethi women to Shallan&#8217;s presence… Please feel free to bring it all up in the comments! There’s plenty to keep us busy until next week, when we follow Adolin into the men’s sitting room for some frustrating confrontations during the storm, and then return with him to the Kholin complex for the aftermath.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 48: No More Weakness</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Li’l Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>the Davar estate<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Inverse Pattern, Vedeledev, Chach</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>IN WHICH</strong> Shallan, Balat, and Wikim act like a normal family and get into a pun-off; a carriage arrives; shouting ensues; Jushu is given away in payment for his own gambling debts—House Davar’s debts are too great to allow anything else; Shallan buys him back with two knives and love; more shouting follows; Father has found an ominous outlet for his anger.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Quote of the Week</h4>
<blockquote><p>“You are the type of man who profits from the gambling of others. You know that it usually leads to loss. I give you items of real value. Take them. Please?”</p>
<p>The man considered. He held out his hands for the daggers, and his man passed them over. He unsheathed one of the daggers and inspected it. “Name for me one reason I should show this man pity. In my house, he was an arrogant glutton, acting without thought for the difficulty he would cause you, his family.”</p>
<p>“Our mother was murdered,” Shallan said. “That night, as I cried, Jushu held me.” It was all she had.</p></blockquote>
<p>This makes me cry all over again—for the little Shallan who didn’t understand why her mother tried to kill her, why she had to defend herself against the one who should protect her, and for the family who has now been torn apart by the death and the deception it brought. Much as I want to kick Jushu up one side and down the other, I also feel pity for him; he found his “escape” in a way just as self-destructive as his twin’s original plan, but he never escaped from his escape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Commentary</h4>
<p>Once again, the whole Davar scene makes my heart hurt.</p>
<p>This chapter starts out so cheerfully: Shallan’s efforts at Middlefest are paying off. Balat has pretty much stopped killing cremlings for fun, as his relationship with Eylita has developed further—directly resulting, I think, from the walk Shallan set up for them. He’s trying hard to man up and be a leader, even as their father descends further into his own private gloom, ambition, and madness. Wikim, too, has changed dramatically. He is thoroughly enjoying his maths, with the approval and support of the Davar ardents—support that for once even went so far as to rebuke Lord Davar for his anger, claiming that the Almighty approved of Wikim’s interests. He has come so far, in fact, that he is no longer suicidal, and by way of proof, he gives Shallan his pouch of blackbane. (DUN!)</p>
<p>In fact, Balat is much better mentally, and Wikim is much healthier physically <em>and</em> mentally, and they’re sitting in the gardens together, laughing and teasing one another. Their conversation is a hoot, especially when Wikim starts tossing metaphors to Shallan to see what she can make of them. Just like, you know, a <em>real</em> family… although Shallan is still trying too hard to distract them when any negative interactions come up.</p>
<p>And then we find that, apparently, Shallan was unable to do anything for Jushu like she had done for Balat and Wikim. Whether she never had the chance, or was unable to come up with anything that worked, we don’t know—but Jushu has still been out playing Prodigal Son to the hilt, gambling away somewhat more than his share of the family’s (non-existent) fortune. Now (if you’ll forgive the mixed metaphors) the time has come to pay the piper, and he has nothing with which to pay. A quick look at the books makes it clear that whether he wants to or not, Lin Davar has no money to redeem his son’s debts.</p>
<p>This is a bad, bad, bad place to be, and all the optimism of the first pages is blown out like a candle in a highstorm. <em>::sigh::</em></p>
<p>We don’t really know whether Shallan had made a similar attempt to help her father, but she does think that he’d been doing better. Whatever caused that—mostly likely simple lack of provocation—it’s over now. There’s a chilling incident when she goes to him to ask that he reconsider his denial of Jushu. For the first time in probably <em>ever</em>, he yells at her; when she (foolishly?) points out the apparent folly of his approach to “fixing” their problems, things get scary:</p>
<blockquote><p>He looked at her, face shadowed but eyes reflecting light, like twin embers in the dark of his skull. In that moment, Shallan felt a terrifying hatred from her father. He strode over, grabbing her by the arms. Her satchel dropped to the floor.</p>
<p>“I’ve done this for <em>you</em>,” he growled, holding her arms in a tight, painful grip. “And you <em>will</em> obey. I’ve gone wrong, somewhere, in letting you learn to question me.”</p>
<p>She whimpered at the pain.</p>
<p>“There will be changes in this house,” Father said. “No more weakness. I’ve found a way…”</p>
<p>“Please, stop.”</p>
<p>He looked down at her and seemed to see the tears in her eyes for the first time.</p>
<p>“Father…” she whispered.</p>
<p>He looked upward. Toward his rooms. She knew he was looking toward Mother’s soul. He dropped her then, causing her to tumble to the floor, red hair covering her face.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is, quite possibly, the closest either one ever comes to acknowledging the truth. It also strengthens my belief that his love for her has, over time and perhaps with Odium’s influence, been turned to equal parts fear of what she could do if she felt sufficiently threatened by him. That bit with the “terrifying hatred” makes me reasonably confident that Odium is involved here.</p>
<p>She defies him, however obliquely, long enough to redeem Jushu from his creditors. The results of her defiance, though… The serving maid is bloodied and has a broken arm (at least), and her father makes it eminently clear that this is what will happen as the alternative to hurting Shallan. Disobey, and someone else will pay the price.</p>
<p>Agony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Stormwatch</h4>
<p>This takes place three years ago, four months after Middlefest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Sprenspotting</h4>
<p>Angerspren, shamespren, fearspren. The Davar home is not a happy place these days, and the spren reflect it. Also, no Pattern… unless… well, we’ll go to Ars Arcanum for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>All Creatures Shelled and Feathered</h4>
<p>I just have to point out a couple of small items. One, of course, is Sakisa the axehound, who totally acts like any dog. The other amused me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vines shook and withdrew before her, though as her pace sped up, she stepped on more and more of them, feeling them writhe beneath her feet and try to yank back. Cultivated vines had poor instincts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Ars Arcanum</h4>
<p>So about that missing spren… Is it possible that Shallan was inadvertently Lightweaving with Balat and Wikim? She hasn’t <em>consciously</em> connected with Pattern for a long time, but she did <em>something</em> at Middlefest, during her conversation with Hoid. Could she also have done <em>something</em> with her brothers as well?</p>
<p>I honestly don’t think she did; I think she simply gave them a focus other than their pain, their fear, and themselves. But it’s an interesting thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Heraldic Symbolism</h4>
<p>The Heralds for this chapter are Vedeledev and Chach. I’m thinking that Vedeledev is the Healer, reflecting the impact Shallan’s efforts have had on Balat and Wikim. I suppose the number four could be significant, being as Jushu is the fourth son, but it seems less likely. Chach could, perhaps represent the Dustbringers, but I think it’s more likely she’s here as Guard and/or for bravery. I’m guessing probably <em>not</em> obedience, unless you consider Shallan being obedient to Hoid’s encouragement to</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Keep cutting at those thorns, strong one… Make a path for the light…</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well. That’s enough of that. Come commiserate with me in the comments, and next week we can cheer up when Shallan and Adolin have a real date. We’ll need the fun of that chapter, after the grief of this one!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 47: Feminine Wiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Sebarial’s manor &amp; warcamp<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Pattern, Paliah, Shalash</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> there are maps, maps, maps—all showing Urithiru in different places; Pattern reads Dawnchant, because </em>patterns<em>; Vorin name games are weird; connections between the Urithiru legends begin to take shape; Shallan takes a bath; Pattern is disconcertingly curious about human anatomy, especially the private bits; Shallan realizes that she will probably never return to Jah Keved, considers her efforts to communicate with her brothers, and begins to develop plans to bring them to join her instead; she hurriedly prepares to meet her betrothed, wondering how to go about this wooing gig; on her way out, she wonders about Sebarial and Palona, and how such a smart man could have such chaotic ledgers; getting into the carriage, she checks with her soldiers and slaves to see how they are doing—well—and then proceeds to spend the ride playing with Stormlight; after some consideration, she decides not to use illusion as makeup when she meets Adolin.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Quote of the Week</h4>
<blockquote><p>“How do you reach a city if not by roads?” Shallan asked. “Nohadon could walk there, or so he claimed. But others do not speak of riding, or walking, to Urithiru.” True, there were few accounts of people visiting the city. It was a legend. Most modern scholars considered it a myth.</p>
<p>She needed more information. She scrambled over to Jasnah’s trunk, digging out one of her notebooks. “She said that Urithiru wasn’t on the Shattered Plains,” Shallan said, “but what if the pathway to it is here? Not an ordinary pathway, though. Urithiru was the city of Surgebinders. Of ancient wonders, like Shardblades.”</p>
<p>“Mm…” Pattern said softly. “Shardblades are no wonder…”</p>
<p>Shallan found the reference she was searching for. It wasn’t the quote she found curious, but Jasnah’s annotation of it. <em>Another folktale, this one recorded in </em>Among the Darkeyed<em>, by Calinam. Page 102. Stories of instantaneous travel and the Oathgates pervade these tales.</em></p>
<p>Instantaneous travel. Oathgates.</p>
<p>“That’s what she was coming here for,” Shallan whispered. “She thought she could find a passageway here, on the Plains. But they’re barren stormlands, just stone, crem, and greatshells.” She looked up at Pattern. “We <em>really</em> need to get out there, onto the Shattered Plains.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Two lovely little bits of foreshadowing here that I just have to point out.</p>
<p>“Shardblades are no wonder…”—not when you’ve <em>been</em> one, I guess. Thanks for the hint, Pattern, but I still didn’t catch on for a long time.</p>
<p>The whole thing of reaching a city not by roads, of a pathway from the Shattered plains, of ancient wonders, of instantaneous travel, of Oathgates… When I first read this, I had no idea how Brandon was going to make this happen. Sometimes I’m really glad I don’t figure these things out from the hints and foreshadows; discovering it along with Shallan was way better than merely having my suspicions confirmed! (On the other hand, I vaguely recall figuring out just enough about the Blades to be completely blown away by a) being right and b) getting a fulfillment so vastly <em>grander</em> than I suspected.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Research into the location of Urithiru now begins in earnest, as Shallan gets out every map she’s been able to acquire. The antics of cartographers are understandable, if annoying: most of them apparently consider their own land to be the most important, and therefore draw it at a larger scale than the rest of the world. Not quite sure how that works… I guess everything else just gets misshapen. The funny part is that none of them seem to claim that Urithiru is within their borders—it’s always just outside. That still places it all over the where, with no two maps agreeing. Poor Shallan.</p>
<p>Knowing what we know, of course, it makes a lot more sense; no one is quite sure exactly where it is, but each country (of the ten Silver Kingdoms, anyway) had a gateway that could get you there. It would be interesting to see all those maps; did they typically place Urithiru just outside the border nearest the location of their own Oathgate?</p>
<p>I wonder if the next book will show us Navani and Pattern working together to figure out the Dawnchant completely. Pattern is so adorably smug about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You are not as good with patterns. You are abstract. You think in lies and tell them to yourselves. That is fascinating, but it is not good for patterns.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Oddly enough, this is what segues into the best deduction Shallan has yet made—that Pattern’s way of looking at things, of seeing patterns but not metaphors, is the correct approach to “the pathway to Urithiru.”</p>
<p>Incidentally, I love the way Brandon stuck inconsistencies and general weirdness into the linguistics. Poor Pattern; not only do people have too many names (in this case, Nohadon), but the honorific name the ardents came up with to meet the need for symmetry isn’t symmetrical unless you understand the quirk about the <em>h</em> sound. So apparently, Nohadon would actually be written No<em>d</em>adon or something like that. (Unfortunately, my computer doesn’t do the diacritical markings… or not without getting into more tomfoolery than I’m up for. I’ll just italicize it, okay?) So a Vorin speaker would see No<em>d</em>adon, which is all lovely symmetry, and say Nohadon, which is by definition (and by definition only!) symmetrical. <em>Obviously</em>. Poor Pattern. At least he gets her back by recognizing the way in which the various scripts derive from the Dawnchant. Obviously.</p>
<p>Other tidbits: Shallan has set in motion the means to reconnect with her brothers after the loss of her half of their original spanreed, and plans to try to persuade them to leave the family estates and join her instead. Presumably, all this was done with the stipend Sebarial is indeed paying her—along with buying replacements for as many of the lost books as she could find.</p>
<p>Her slaves and soldiers seem to be doing well; the slave En even smiles at her, as he begins to get used to a much more pleasant mistress than he’s had for a long, long time. Vathah is grumpy, as is his habit; I can’t remember off the top of my head what finally shakes him out of it. (If anything.) And it still feels odd to read Gaz as a sympathetic character, given the way he was presented in <em>The Way of Kings</em>. He chuckles, he has an ear for wordplay, he eagerly searches out the books she wants. I still want to know more of his backstory; is this his natural self, and the foul-tempered lout of the previous book merely the effect of the debts? I can’t help thinking there’s more to his story. But it probably doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Stormwatch</h4>
<p>This is the next day, after Kaladin’s meet-up with the self-styled “patriots.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Sprenspotting</h4>
<p>I have to say, Shallan’s bath is much more entertaining than Elayne’s… mostly by virtue of her efforts to convince herself that there’s no need to be embarrassed by Pattern’s presence despite his masculine voice and identification. After all, the tub and the walls had spren, and that wasn’t a problem…</p>
<p>Shallan’s bath was also a lot shorter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Ars Arcanum</h4>
<p>This is rather a breakthrough chapter for Shallan. Not only does she begin to piece together the Urithiru puzzle, she makes progress on her Lightweaving and even figures out how to withdraw the Stormlight from an Illusion and make it go away. Short of draining every sphere in range, anyway, which is pretty much what always happened before.</p>
<p>She does have a block, though, that reminds me very much of the Aes Sedai weaving the One Power: she needs to sketch something in order to create an Illusion. Pattern indicates that it <em>shouldn’t</em> be necessary—which also answers an earlier debate about how someone like Elhokar could become a Lightweaver with no artistic training. Most Lightweavers don’t need to draw before they can create an Illusion. (Or, presumably, do any other creative artwork.) But for Shallan, it’s necessary. For now, at least… though I do have some hope that she’ll get over that as she grows into greater acceptance of who she is. Which reminds me…</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m quite good at that (inhaling Stormlight),” Shallan said sourly, “considering how short a time I’ve been doing it.”</p>
<p>“Short time?” Pattern said. “But we first…”</p>
<p>She stopped listening until he was done.</p></blockquote>
<p>Argh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Heraldic Symbolism</h4>
<p>Paliah probably reflects the Scholar, as Shallan digs through all the maps and other information she has available, returning to the search for the way to Urithiru. Shalash, presumably, is the Artist and Lightweaver, as Shallan does a fair amount of both sketching and practicing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Words of Radiants</h4>
<blockquote><p><em>Yet, were the orders not disheartened by so great a defeat, for the Lightweavers provided spiritual sustenance; they were enticed by those glorious creations to venture on a second assault. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">—From Words of Radiance, chapter 21, page 10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me how much difference a single word can make in the tone of a sentence. “<em>Enticed</em>” makes me deeply distrustful of the Lightweavers in this scenario, whatever it was. Or maybe it’s just that the writer didn’t approve of the second assault. <em>Or</em> trust the Lightweavers. I have to keep reminding myself that the author of the in-book book is not, perhaps, the most reliable of narrators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Shipping Wars</h4>
<p>Shallan’s thoughts at the end of the chapter are thoroughly endearing, at least to me. Like most girls, she’s been comparing herself to the other women in the vicinity, and comes up short—both literally and figuratively (double meaning intended)—in her own estimation. It’s only reasonable that she would consider using her Lightweaving to just… augment things a little, here and there. Wisely, even though she calls herself foolish for it, she chooses to refrain and meet Adolin unenhanced. Also, this:</p>
<blockquote><p>She’d have to rely, instead, upon her feminine wiles.</p>
<p>She wished she knew if she had any.</p></blockquote>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when we again go back in time to the darkening world that is the Davar family estate. Steel yourselves… but for now, head for the comment section and have fun!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 46: Patriots</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Kaladin<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Dalinar’s warcamp<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Spears, Talenel, Nalan</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Kaladin reviews bridge crews, with mixed results; Hobber serves dinner while Renarin washes the dishes; Lopen has cousins; Kaladin gives Shen a spear and apologizes for earlier fear; Shen starts to speak but is forestalled by the appearance of Moash; Kaladin reluctantly goes out drinking with the guys; chouta is eaten in differing forms; Kaladin is confronted by the imminent possibility of married soldiers; Rock tells of the Horneater Peaks and how his people came there; Moash has arranged a meeting with his associates, and Syl warns Kaladin to be careful; Kaladin is unconvinced, but admits to himself that their arguments are almost too good; he tells Moash to stop meeting with them. Yeah, sure, Kaladin. Just like that.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>“If a king is destroying his country,” the mercenary said, “is it not the right— the duty— of the people to see him removed?”</p>
<p>“If he <em>were</em> removed,” Moash said, “what would happen? Ask yourself that, Kaladin.”</p>
<p>“Dalinar would probably take the throne,” Kaladin said. Elhokar had a son back in Kholinar, a child, barely a few years old. Even if Dalinar only proclaimed himself regent in the name of the rightful heir, he would rule.</p>
<p>“The kingdom would be far better off with him at the head,” Graves said.</p>
<p>“He practically rules the place anyway,” Kaladin said.</p>
<p>“No,” Danlan said. “Dalinar holds himself back. He knows he should take the throne, but hesitates out of love for his dead brother. The other highprinces interpret this as weakness.”</p>
<p>“We need the Blackthorn,” Graves said, pounding the table. “This kingdom is going to fall otherwise. The death of Elhokar would spur Dalinar to action. We would get back the man we had twenty years ago, the man who unified the highprinces in the first place.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, the assumptions people make, knowing nothing of another person’s heart and mind… and the lies people tell to convince others of their position. “Patriots” indeed. Most of them are merely foolish and presumptuous (and tools); Graves is a liar and a master manipulator, and I want to pound his face just a little. (Yes. Yes, I do.)</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>Welp. Clearly Brandon didn’t write <em>this</em> chapter with a poor reread-blogger in mind. There are two <em>completely different</em> revelations in this chapter, and I want to focus on both. But… they’re completely different and unrelated. *sigh* So we’ll tuck Rock’s story into Sprenspotting, because it clearly involves powerful spren and stuff, and here we’ll just look at Kaladin’s interaction with his bridge crews and with Moash’s “patriots.”</p>
<p>In a weird way, it’s nice to see that Kaladin’s training routines are not universally successful. (In the interest of realism, I guess?) Bridge Seventeen has come together as a unit; while they’re still a bit sloppy as soldiers, they have developed a team identity, and they’re good enough to advance to another level of training: limited patrols. So, yay 17! Nineteen looks to be not far behind, so that’s good. Eighteen, though… not so much. They’re still a bunch of sloppy, defensive, discordant individuals. Looks like they need a round of chasm duty.</p>
<p>Back at Bridge Four, Hobber (poor Hobber!!) is serving dinner under Rock’s proud watch, while Renarin is quietly washing dishes; apparently the rest have accepted his presence and this service, finally. Lopen has yet more cousins joining Bridge Four; I remember being more than a little worried about them on my first read! This looked so much like a set-up for betrayal: with all these random Herdazians slipping in, I was sure one of them would be a spy or a traitor. I’m delighted to have been proven wrong. Also, foreshadowing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left">Kaladin found Lopen nearby, staring at his hand—which he held before himself in a fist for some reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We know what you’re up to with that sphere, dude… Heh.</p>
<p>Perhaps the single best moment in this chapter, though, is the one where Kaladin finds Shen stacking sacks of tallew grain in the storage room.</p>
<blockquote><p>“At ease, soldier,” Kaladin said softly, stepping up to him. “I spoke to Dalinar Kholin earlier today and asked if I could arm you. He asked if I trusted you. I told him the truth.” Kaladin held out his spear to the parshman. “I do.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And then the moment that makes me very sad… Shen clearly wants to talk to Kaladin about something, but they’re interrupted by Moash, who wants to drag Kaladin off to meet with his associates. Knowing the truth about Shen now, and (at least some of) the truth about Moash’s “friends,” I wish Moash had just put a sock in it.</p>
<p>He didn’t, of course, so Kaladin decides to act more human than he feels for the sake of his men, and out with the guys he traipses. And he meets Graves, and Danlan, and a couple of mercenaries who all think they’re doing this for the good of Alethkar. They’re convinced that if nasty old king Elhokar was killed – preferably in an “accident” – Dalinar would take the throne and be a <em>real</em> king. The Blackthorn would return, the man who united Alethkar twenty years ago, and everything would be all better.</p>
<p>In a way, I can’t blame the mercenaries; to some extent, they can be justified as patriots in wanting something better for their country than what they’ve got. (Elhokar <em>is</em> doing a terrible job of being king, even though some of his worst excesses have been reined in lately.) Danlan ought to have a little better insight, I think; she’s been in fairly close contact with Dalinar, and it seems she should realize that he’s not the storied Blackthorn of twenty years ago. I realize she can’t know about his vow to never take the throne, so maybe she can be forgiven for thinking that he is merely hesitant because of his love for his dead brother.  Still, she doesn’t seem to be thinking for herself very much. Or she’s lying.</p>
<p>Graves, though… As we’ll see later on, he obviously thinks killing Elhokar will be good for Alethkar, but his higher allegiance is to Taravangian and the almighty stinking Diagram, which calls for Dalinar to be killed as well. Honestly, who does he think will lead Alethkar then? Or does he care? Or does he think Taravangian will become king of Alethkar too, and then he’ll fix everything?</p>
<p>Whatever his thoughts on the matter, he’s lying about… pretty much everything. And I do <em>not</em> like him.</p>
<p>Fortunately, neither does Kaladin, and so he says he’ll consider it, hoping that he’ll be able to walk away alive. <em>Un</em>fortunately, and probably due to Moash’s information, Graves knew all the right lines. Despite his orders to Moash to stop meeting them and stop talking about it, Kaladin is more than halfway to thinking they might be right even as he knows what they’re doing is wrong.</p>
<p>Oh, Kaladin.</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>This is three days after the events of Kaladin’s previous chapter, when he confirmed that Moash <em>had</em> had something to do with the assassination attempt and agreed to meet with Moash’s “friends.” Thirty-three days remain in the countdown.</p>
<h4><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h4>
<p>It’s like Goldilocks up in here, y’all. Little spren, medium-sized spren, and great big spren.</p>
<p>Syl has seen “more of those red spren” – mostly out of the corner of her eyes, watching her. Creepy. Stormspren? Kaladin certainly ties it to the countdown and the Weeping.</p>
<p>Flamespren… are mostly insignificant. Kaladin is exhausted, and he just wants to sit and eat and watch them dance. I can understand this. (Do we know what they look like in the Cognitive realm? I wonder if it’s relaxing to watch them there. Somehow, I doubt it.)</p>
<p>Sylphrena represents the medium-sized spren today; she’s certainly not small in effect, no matter that at one point she goes completely invisible. She’s turned into quite the little mommy in this chapter – although, come to think of it, she’s been like that a lot as she developed the capacity to understand Kaladin. She scolds him for not taking care of himself, and urges him to be human for a while and go out with the guys. She might have regretted that one, though, because when he goes to meet with Moash’s “patriots” she warns him to be careful, and even he can’t see her. (I wonder… did she go completely invisible because there was someone in that room she knew would be able to see her? If so, who?)</p>
<p>Then there are the great big spren… the ones Rock calls gods in this story, although, yes, he seems to consider all spren (or at least the sentient ones) to be gods.</p>
<blockquote><p>“These are gods, yes,” Rock said, following Kaladin’s gaze [toward Syl]. “Yes. Some gods, though, they are more powerful than others.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Given what we know of the Cosmere, and what little we know of Roshar’s ancient history, I’m more than a little bit willing to believe that Rock’s story is, at its bones, the truth. With help from the greater spren, why not? There may also have been help – either disguised as coming from the spren, or directly – from Honor and/or Cultivation. It’s fairly clear that Lunu’anaki was coming out of a Shardpool, and it’s possible that there is more than one up there. I’d really, really like to know more about the Horneater peaks…</p>
<p>At any rate, I believe it’s safe to say that the Unkalaki had Shard assistance to either find or create a habitable space on the peaks; perhaps they were originally intended to be “gatekeepers” of a sort. They’re well-positioned to keep anyone from accidentally falling into the Shardpool(s), as well as to either obstruct or assist those coming from elsewhere.</p>
<h4><strong>Haven’t We Met Somewhere Before?</strong></h4>
<p>Well, well. It’s our old friend Lunu-anaki. A Hoid by any other name is still as snarky.</p>
<p>Having just finished rereading <em>Elantris</em>, the description of Lunu-anaki as a young man with white hair made me wonder if he might be an Elantrian, but too many other things fit specifically with Hoid. So I’ll go with that. For one thing, Rock describes him as “Maybe Alethi, though skin was lighter.” An Elantrian (unless he was disguised) would have silvery skin, not merely lighter than a typical Alethi. Then there’s, “Lunu-anaki cannot hurt man. Is forbidden by other gods.” We’ve seen elsewhere (<em>Elantris</em> and <em>Warbreaker</em>, I think? as well as last week’s “Middlefest” chapter) that Hoid is for some reason constitutionally unable to hurt anyone – physically, anyway. And of course, there’s Sigzil’s reaction to his description, making it fairly clear that he believes this just might be his former tutor.</p>
<p>The clincher just might be the fact that he mocked Rock’s beard and thought his name was funny. That’s a very Hoid thing to do.</p>
<h4><strong>You Have to Break a Lot of Rockbuds</strong></h4>
<p>Or deep-fried cremling claws… Yum? Eurgh. Apparently chouta can be made with lots of different contents. Horneater-style burritos? I think I’ll pass. I’ll stick with the fried flangria, even if it is Soulcast.</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Talenel and Nalan are readily understandable choices for this chapter’s Heralds. Talenel, the Soldier, is what Kaladin is all about on this particular evening. Nalan clearly reflects the “justice” that Moash is seeking, and that the others at least pretend to. I can’t help wondering if he’s got a deeper meaning as well, but I can’t quite put my finger on it.</p>
<h4><strong>Words of Radiants</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p><em>When Simol was informed of the arrival of the Edgedancers, a concealed consternation and terror, as is common in such cases, fell upon him; although they were not the most demanding of orders, their graceful, limber movements hid a deadliness that was, by this time, quite renowned; also, they were the most articulate and refined of the Radiants.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211;From <em>Words of Radiance</em>, chapter 20, page 12</p>
<p>While we’ll probably never know who Simol was (unless he turns out to have been a key part of whatever led to the Recreance), this little snippet gives us a couple of juicy tidbits about the Edgedancers. They were not the most demanding of orders; they were graceful, limber, and deadly; they were articulate and refined. All these combine to make me think that the Edgedancer-spren, whatever they are, would look on Adolin as quite a good candidate.</p>
<p>Maybe Simol was something like Sadeas. That would be poetic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A note on scheduling: there will be no reread post next week. I’m going on vacation, and there’s just no way I’m getting another chapter done before I leave.  And I refuse to bury myself in my computer when I&#8217;m in places like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Leon-Kauffman-2-Reubens-meadows.jpg?fit=0%2C%209999&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-181810 aligncenter" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Leon-Kauffman-2-Reubens-meadows.jpg?fit=740%2C%209999&#038;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C493px" alt="Leon Kauffman 2 Reubens meadows" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>(Photo credit to my cousin Leon Kauffman, who takes fantastic pictures of home.)</p>
<p>Fortunately, there seem to be a lot of other Sanderson-related things happening on Tor.com these days, so keep your eyes open for those. We’ll meet again in two weeks, when Shallan and Pattern research maps and old scripts, and conclude mostly that they need more information.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 45: Middlefest</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Li’l Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Jah Keved<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Inverse Pattern, Vedeledev, Joker</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Shallan observes a chicken, and is overwhelmed by a fair with five hundred people in the same place; as she accompanies her father, she reflects on her life as it is these days; Lord Davar is patronized by someone of his own rank, which is naturally infuriating; Shallan slips away at an implicit dismissal, and sets off on the business of helping her family in the ways she can: she smuggles a note from Eylita to Balat to set up a tryst, thus extricating him from the axehound fights with which he has an unhealthy fascination; when she returns to her father, she finds him speaking with a stranger, who reacts oddly to her presence; the &#8220;messenger&#8221; slips something into his own drink; Lord Davar declares that Helaran is officially disinherited, and changes the remaining brothers’ titles; he asks Shallan to speak to Wikim, who is refusing to leave the carriage; she does so, presenting him with a distraction in the form of math problems; as she leaves in despair, she comes across the stranger again; he tosses a lot of cryptic questions and comments around, but then turns her to look at Wikim, who is actually smiling as he works on the maths she left him; the stranger tells a story, and gently guides Shallan into some inadvertent Lightweaving.</em></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>“I assumed he’d sent you here. I mean, that coming to us was your primary purpose.”</p>
<p>“Turns out that it was. Tell me, young one. Do spren speak to you?”</p>
<p>The lights going out, life drained from them.</p>
<p>Twisted symbols the eye should not see.</p>
<p>Her mother’s soul in a box.</p>
<p>“I . . .” she said. “No. Why would a spren speak to me?”</p>
<p>“No voices?” the man said, leaning forward. “Do spheres go dark when you are near?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Shallan said, “but I should be getting back to my father. He will be missing me.”</p>
<p>“Your father is slowly destroying your family,” the messenger said. “Your brother was right on that count. He was wrong about everything else.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, the memories, Shallan. Let them come! But of course, she doesn’t, and can’t. She’s not ready to fully remember these things. But it does tell us clearly that before her mother died, Shallan was definitely using Stormlight and seeing the Cryptics.</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>Once again, we get a glimpse of the abject brokenness of the Davar family, and I don’t know who I feel most sorry for. Lin, who is so subject to fits of anger, though Shallan can “remember a time when she’d rarely, if ever, seen him angry.” Balat, who “hadn’t acquired this fascination with death until Mother had left them.” Wikim, who has given in to the despair and is actively preparing for his own suicide. Jushu, who in his twin’s estimation, “will destroy himself. It’s only a matter of time.” Malise, who “spends one night in two weeping.” Shallan, who is trying so hard to fix them, to bring them back from the brink of their various self-destructive activities, recognizing that they’re all trying, but they’re all unraveling anyway.</p>
<p>All in all, I identify with Shallan the most, because I know that feeling of wanting to fix things, wanting to help people who really don’t want to <em>be</em> helped, unable to just shrug it off and let them do their own thing because that thing is clearly leading them down to despair and destruction.</p>
<p>That said, I think it’s still Lin I feel the most sorry for. The first time (we know about) that he tried to protect his beloved daughter, he was forcibly prevented and had to watch as she protected herself against all odds, and in so doing condemned herself. But she was only condemned if anyone knew, and so he protected her a different way: not with his body or his knife, but with his silence and at the cost of his reputation, his family, and his sanity. What moment was it that opened him to Odium’s influence?</p>
<p>For all the misery of the family, though, in this chapter there are glimpses of hope. Balat leaves the axehound fights for the sake of a walk with Eylita, Lin has the self-awareness to ask Shallan to speak to Wikim on his behalf rather than risking what he might do in his current mental state, and Wikim develops an interest in Shallan’s gift of math problems despite himself. And Shallan… Shallan actually does a Lightweaving – probably her first in two and a half years.</p>
<p>For the reader, though not necessarily for Shallan, the most encouraging part is her conversation with Hoid. Typically cryptic, but gentle and encouraging. And hopeful.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Two blind men waited at the end of an era, contemplating beauty.”</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>Three and a half years ago, when Shallan was about 14.1 years old. This is two and a half years after the first flashback to “Red Carpet, Once White.”</p>
<h4><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h4>
<p>The first mention of a spren is a windspren who darts through a merchant’s enclosure, making objects stick together. Is this a common trait of windspren, or does it mean there’s a “young” honorspren hanging around?</p>
<p>We learn here, not a reason, but a common behavior of spren: when people are in a crowd, even though emotions are high, spren are rare. Why would that be? I have a vague recollection that there’s a WoB on this somewhere, but I don’t remember it. Anyone?</p>
<p>Finally, there’s Hoid’s question to Shallan (see QOTW): do spren speak to you? But she won’t quite remember. *sigh*</p>
<h4><strong>All Creatures Shelled and Feathered</strong></h4>
<p>Chickens! If you haven’t already, you really need to reread the first page or so of this chapter. It’s funny to see a parakeet  (or something similar to one, anyway) described from the perspective of someone who’s never seen a bird before, up close and personal. This one has even been taught to speak a little, which makes Shallan call it a Voidbringer – an animal that speaks. (I wonder if there’s some mythology in which those two are inextricably linked.)</p>
<p>We have an assortment of local flora: jella trees, breechtrees (which apparently produce cotton) and shum, whatever that is. Also fauna: along with the axehounds in the fights, there’s a mink slinking around in the shadows. But… now I wonder. Shallan is surprised to see the mink, expecting all those in the area to have been trapped by now. And it’s not long after this that she finds Hoid up in the tree. Was he Lightweaving himself into an illusion of a mink? Tricky business, that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ars Arcanum:</strong>  It’s fascinating to watch Hoid gently but persistently maneuver Shallan into Lightweaving, once he realizes what she is. Too polite (or too innocent) to just walk away from him, she has to get annoyed with his stories and questions before she unintentionally reaches beyond her mental blocks to create the Illusion for herself of her ideal Beauty.</p>
<h4><strong>Haven’t We Met Somewhere Before?</strong></h4>
<p>Oh, hello, Wit. Carrying a metals vial around everywhere now, are we? I wonder… if I’m right that he was disguised as the mink, was that a Yolen-style Lightweaving, or a Rosharan Lightweaving, or some kind of Allomantic power I don’t remember? Because I can’t think of anything he does in this chapter that indicates Allomancy, other than drinking the metals.</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>Vedeledev and the Joker are both obvious, though there may be deeper meanings I’ve missed. (Could it be?!)  Shallan is trying her hardest to heal her family by any means available, and Hoid is all over it. The chapter title is unambiguous, to say the least.</p>
<h4><strong>Just Sayin’</strong></h4>
<p>A couple of goodies this week, aside from the chickens. The parakeet (or parrot) calls itself “Jek son of none” which was, IIRC, the original name of Szeth. There’s a new term here for the time just opposite the Weeping: it’s called “the midpeace” and is apparently another time when there are no highstorms. My favorite, though was Shallan’s thought on freedom: as valuable as an emerald broam, and <strong>as rare as a larkin</strong>. Larkin FTW!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when Kaladin goes out with the guys and attends a Meeting. Grr.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 44: One Form of Justice</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Kaladin<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Dalinar’s warcamp, lighteyes training ground<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Spears, Chach, Nalan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Kaladin feels out of place; Zahel uses colorful metaphors and stones; Renarin eats lunch; Shardblade training begins for Bridge Four; Adolin gives his implicit approval; Shallan shows up on the training ground; Kaladin and Adolin get into a verbal sparring match, resulting in a draw; Shallan offhandedly bests them both and wanders off to sketch; Adolin has his arrogance handed to him on a platter, and seems to enjoy it; Kaladin is baffled. Moash reveals his bitter backstory; he reluctantly agrees to back off his involvement with the assassins if Kaladin will agree to meet with them once; Kaladin attempts to return to practice, but mostly stews about unfathomable questions of life, society and theology; he learns what a lastclap is and why not to practice it.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Quote of the Week</h4>
<blockquote><p>“What is she doing here?” Kaladin asked.</p>
<p>“Come to watch me while I spar, presumably,” Adolin said. “I usually have to kick them out.”</p>
<p>“Them?”</p>
<p>“You know. Girls who want to gawk at me while I fight. I wouldn’t mind, but if we allowed it, they’d clog the entire grounds every time I came. Nobody would be able to get any sparring done.”</p>
<p>Kaladin raised an eyebrow at him.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Adolin reached Shallan, who—humming to herself—passed him right by without looking. Adolin raised a hand, mouth opened to speak, as he turned and watched her walk farther across the courtyard. Her eyes were on Nall, head ardent of the practice grounds. Shallan bowed to her in reverence.</p>
<p>Adolin scowled, turning to jog after Shallan, passing Kaladin, who smirked at him.</p>
<p>“Come to watch you, I see,” Kaladin said. “Completely fascinated by you, obviously.”</p>
<p>“Shut up,” Adolin growled.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>::gigglesnort::</em> I know, it’s not the most profound or significant part of the chapter, but it’s my <em>favorite</em>. I laugh out loud every time I read this. Including, of course, the bit I left out, where Adolin catches himself explaining to Kaladin why he let himself get betrothed to someone he’d never met. The development of Adolin’s character throughout this book is delightful, as he becomes more dimensional to the reader.</p>

<h4>Commentary</h4>
<p>Lots of interesting little tidbits in this chapter, so of course I won’t be able to cover them all. Still, we’ll give it a go, as will Kaladin &amp; company.</p>
<p>One: a demonstration of just how much difference being an ardent makes in Vorin gender expectations. Zahel turns Kaladin and his men over to another ardent, Ivis, to go through sword forms and sparring moves—and Ivis is a woman. She keeps her hand gloved, but beyond that she simply wears the standard ardent’s flowing clothing and shaved head, and she’s apparently quite well versed in sword-fighting, up to and including Shardblade-fighting. Kaladin thinks it’s odd to see a woman holding a sword, but no one else seems to notice or care—she’s an ardent, and this is her task, so it’s all cool.</p>
<p>Once he gets over thinking about a woman with a sword, Kaladin finally manages to learn something. He may not like swords, but he does realize that practicing with them and learning the stances will still help when he has to fight someone who is using a sword, no matter what weapon he himself is carrying. Seems obvious, but maybe it isn’t&#8230; or Kaladin needs to practice getting over himself so he can learn other things, too!</p>
<p>And then Shallan shows up. Heh.</p>
<p>Weirdly enough, Kaladin (at this point) can see Ivis as a female ardent, but Shallan is just a lighteyes. Period. Well, I guess he can practice getting over that, too, eventually. He <em>really</em> has a blind spot with Shallan, though; it doesn’t even occur to him, until Teft points it out, that Shallan is perfectly positioned to be a most effective assassin. (Little do they know just <em>how</em> perfectly!)</p>
<p>Another tidbit: Moash’s grandparents were of the second nahn, which is coincidentally the same as Lirin and Kaladin. I’m not sure if this means that Moash himself was also second nahn, though, since he wasn’t actually apprenticed to them, and I think Kaladin only had the “second nahn” ranking because he was the surgeon’s apprentice. Tien was third nahn; I’m guessing Moash was also third, as (IIRC) that’s a stable rank.</p>
<p>Well, the rest of the good stuff fits conveniently into the other units, so let’s jump on into those.</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>It’s the next day, finally! A whole new day!</p>
<h4>Sprenspotting</h4>
<p>Ah, the much-debated gloryspren, which fades into existence near Moash’s head when he first picks up the Shardblade. In this case, it seems drawn to his feelings of elation at actually <em>doing</em> something he had dreamed of, and never imagined he’d ever, ever be allowed to do. Given the occasions on which we’ve seen them, I’m now convinced the term “gloryspren” is a good choice. You just have to take into account the multiple definitions of “glory.”</p>
<p>Sylphrena. I’m not quite sure what I need to say about her, except that once again, she and Kaladin are talking at cross-purposes and not making much progress. She doesn’t ask Kaladin not to pick up the Blade, but she <em>does</em> thank him for not doing so. She agrees (I think!) with the men who are giving Kaladin a hard time about taking himself and his job too seriously, but then she’s distracted at the wrong time. I get chills over this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kaladin sighed, turning to grab his sword, and came face-to-face with Syl hovering behind him. Her tiny eyes had gone wide, hands as fists to her sides.</p>
<p>“What did you just do?” she demanded. “I only heard the last part.”</p>
<p>“Moash was involved,” Kaladin whispered. “I need to follow this through, Syl. If someone is trying to kill the king, it’s my job to investigate them.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” She frowned. “<strong>I felt something. Something else</strong>.” She shook her head. “Kaladin, this is dangerous. We should go to Dalinar.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The emphasis there is mine, because that’s curious. <em>What</em> did she feel? Kaladin agreeing to meet with Moash’s associates? His impulse to tell Dalinar about Moash? His feeling of defeat when he had to decide which course was right, and decided that Bridge-hood loyalty was more important than telling his superior officer the truth?</p>
<p>The worst part comes next, when he gets wound around the axle on the conflicts between social expectations and pseudo-theological contradictions, cycling around to the central conflict of his own life—whether it’s possible to kill in order to protect, or whether it’s possible to protect without killing, and what is the Right thing to do. The more he thrashes around in this mess, the more miserable he makes both himself and Syl. He excels at creating false dichotomies, and also at refusing to listen to Syl when she says things he doesn’t want to hear.</p>
<h4>Haven’t We Met Somewhere Before?</h4>
<p>Well, hello there, Zahel of the colorful metaphors and colorful stones, reflecting that world where everything is about color. (I still can’t quite believe I didn’t catch this on my first read; in hindsight it’s totally obvious. I was expecting to find Heralds hiding in plain sight, so I just wrote off all his quirks as features of ancient history… not features of another history altogether. I still want him to turn out to be Ishar, though. Please?)</p>
<p>Something I’d like to research in <em>Warbreaker</em> is his attitude regarding social/class issues. Here, he’s mostly disgusted that Vorin society has built-in restrictions on who can learn sword-fighting based on their birth. Unlike Vorin tradition, Zahel considers a sword, however valuable, to be just a tool. Did he always feel that way? Clearly I need a reread… but we’ll finish <em>Words of Radiance</em> first, eh?</p>
<h4>Heraldic Symbolism</h4>
<p>Chach, as the Guard, makes perfect sense for this chapter’s general content, which focuses on the preparation of Kaladin and his men to best guard Dalinar and his family. Nalan, as the Judge, makes sense for the conversations between Moash and Kaladin and between Kaladin and Syl, and reflects the chapter title as well. What’s most interesting to me is the conflict between the two; Moash’s attitude toward Elhokar is set as a blatant parallel to Kaladin’s attitude toward Amaram, and Kaladin claims that killing Amaram would be “one form of justice.” By that reasoning, though, Moash killing Elhokar would also be “one form of justice”—but in direct opposition to their duty to protect and guard him. Moash brushes it off, claiming that their job is only to keep <em>Dalinar</em> alive, but Kaladin knows perfectly well that their job is to protect Dalinar, <em>and</em> Elhokar, <em>and</em> Adolin, <em>and</em> Renarin, <em>and</em> Navani… and so the Heralds clash.</p>
<h4>Words of Radiants</h4>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left"><em>But as for the Bondsmiths, they had members only three, which number was not uncommon for them; nor did they seek to increase this by great bounds, for during the times of Madasa, only one of their order was in continual accompaniment of Urithiru and its thrones. Their spren was understood to be specific, and to persuade them to grow to the magnitude of the other orders was seen as seditious. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">–From <em>Words of Radiance</em>, chapter 16, page 14</p>
<p>This one sparks as many questions as it solves. Typical. We now know that there were traditionally very few Bondsmiths, and that apparently at least one Bondsmith was generally in Urithiru during the old days. It leaves us wondering, though, whether all the Bondsmiths were bonded to the Stormfather, or whether each individual was bonded to a different superspren. I subscribe to the theory that all of them were bonded to the Stormfather—in part because of the singular form: “<strong>Their spren <em>was</em></strong> understood to be specific…” Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Also, who—or what—was Madasa? I personally think it would be cool if that was their name for the time of relative peace between Desolations, though I see the Coppermind gurus assume Madasa to be a person. We have no further information—which is okay, I guess, because it probably doesn’t matter any more than a straw in a stormwind.</p>
<h4>Shipping Wars</h4>
<p>Adolin and Shallan FTW! I love the way she throws him for a loop—doing what he expects, but then, well, <em>not</em> what he expects—and he loves it. I’ve always enjoyed the way she simply <em>can’t</em> behave like a proper Vorin lady, and that very difference is what repeatedly takes him off guard and makes him see her as a real, and very interesting, <em>person</em>.</p>
<h4>Just Sayin’</h4>
<p>There are a bunch of goodies in this chapter. “Like a chull in a dining hall.” That’s&#8230; descriptive!</p>
<p>“Their eyes followed that Blade as they’d follow a gorgeous woman taking off her glove.” Aside from an obviously darkeyes mentality, because lighteyes would be appalled at her wearing a glove in the first place, this is cute.</p>
<p>We have a couple of those Herald-curses: “Kelek’s breath” and “Nalan’s hand”—and I still don’t know if there’s supposed to be any significance about the Herald and the breath/hand/eye/ whatever.</p>
<p>And of course, there’s “You’ve got red on your ears”—which isn’t actually a Rosharan saying; it’s apparently Nalthean. Much like our “chip on your shoulder,” this indicates a person with something to prove, spoiling for a fight, angry at everything and everyone. I’d never noticed before, but even though Zahel was speaking specifically to Kaladin, <em>Moash</em> is the one who says, “Can you blame <strong>us</strong>?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when we go back in time three years, to a relatively good day at the fair.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 43: The Ghostbloods</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Sebarial’s Warcamp<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Pattern, Palah, Joker</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Shallan goes adventuring as a darkeyes, and finds it freeing; she nevertheless manages to make herself conspicuous by behaving in ways inconsistent with her disguise; she sets Pattern to watch her back for anyone following, then leaps in fright when he reports; she successfully finds the meeting place—and a lot of strangeness; despite her nervousness, she manages a few nice bits of snark; she holds a very cautious conversation with a man called Mraize who appears to be the local leader; his companions are a peculiar lot, as are the apparent trophies on display; she receives an assignment for “Tyn”: to find out what Amaram is hiding; she is dismissed, and takes Memories of those present on her way out; she is followed by the strangest of the company, and slips her tail by a panicked Lightweaving of a wall; she finally returns to her rooms in Sebarial’s manor, and finds herself flushed with the thrill of her adventure.</em></p>
<h4><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>The guard nodded toward an opening in the wall, and Shallan stared into the blackness there. Steps. Down.</p>
<p><em>Storms, what am I doing? </em></p>
<p>Not being timid. That was what she was doing. Shallan glanced at the brutish guard and raised an eyebrow, forcing her voice to sound calm. “You really went all-out on the decor. How long did you have to look to find a den in the Shattered Plains that had a creepy staircase in it?”</p>
<p>The guard actually smiled. It didn’t make him look any less intimidating.</p></blockquote>
<p>I… don’t really have anything to say about that. I just liked it. Snark under pressure, FTW!</p>
<h4><strong>Commentary</strong></h4>
<p>Oh, Shallan, you’re so naïve sometimes. She’s so happy to be inconspicuous, and laughs at herself when she realizes that as a darkeyes, she can’t expect people to get out of her way… and then she nonchalantly pulls out an emerald mark to pay for something that costs a single clearchip. Oops.</p>
<p>But she is becoming more self-aware:</p>
<blockquote><p>She had business to be about. Part of her didn’t want to go forward with it, obviously, and her mind was trying to distract her. She was becoming increasingly aware of this defense of hers. She used it, she <em>needed</em> it, but she couldn’t let it control her life.</p></blockquote>
<p>This <em>is</em> an improvement! In fact, it’s a huge step: recognizing your defense mechanisms and then having enough self-discipline to choose <em>not</em> to do the thing that has been your only mental protection for many years… it’s <em>huge</em>.</p>
<p>There’s a quick hint here relating to something we talked about a while back<em>—</em>that the warcamps are built on the ruins of something else. The tenement in which she meets the Ghostbloods has not one, but <em>two</em> basement levels, in a place where most buildings don’t bother with eminently-floodable basements. The only question now is whether these cellars are left from the time when this was all part of the nation of Natanatan, or whether they are of more recent construction by the Parshendi.</p>
<p>Most of my comments on the Ghostbloods themselves will be in a section below, but here I have to note the reference to a flashback scene we haven’t got to yet: the bit where Shallan thinks that the man standing with his back to her (which turns out to be Mraize) reminds her of “the messenger” from her childhood. Coming soon to a reread near you&#8230;</p>
<p>She handles herself well in this meeting. While she may resemble jello on the inside, the outside impression is a combination of Jasnah’s self-confidence and Tyn’s boldness. Most importantly, it works; Mraize (and presumably Iyatil) find her plausible and clever, even though she misjudged their readiness to meet with “Tyn’s apprentice.” He’d simply agreed to it with the expectation of killing her and then hunting down Tyn, with or without any information she could provide. That’s cold, dude.</p>
<p>And so, having more or less favorably impressed the Ghostbloods, Shallan is allowed to give herself a name and receive a new assignment. (I still wonder about her choice of “Veil” as a pseudonym, because she articulates no reason for that choice. Well, either it doesn’t matter, or we’ll learn later. Looks like she’s going to have an ongoing relationship with these creepy people.) The assignment will prove interesting on several levels, but we’ll get to that in a future chapter when she manages to infiltrate Amaram’s household for a bit. For now, he’s just a name and an assignment<em>—</em>and an opportunity to prove herself.</p>
<p>There are a lot of little hints in this chapter, connecting the Ghostbloods to much, much wider Cosmere significance. (So much so, in fact, that it really makes me wonder just what they’re up to. I’m pretty sure they don’t care one clearchip about a single person on Roshar, but they do care about the conflict with Odium. The question is, which side are they on?) To keep it &#8220;clean,&#8221; I put all the Worldhopping and varied Investiture facts &amp; speculations into “Haven’t We Met Somewhere Before?” Nothing in there is a plot-significant spoiler for any of the existing books, but there are a lot of Invested items from other worlds. If that kind of tidbit irritates you, you’ll want to skip a <em>large</em> chunk at &#8220;Haven&#8217;t We Met?&#8221; and go on down to the &#8220;Heraldic Symbolism.&#8221;</p>
<h4><strong>Stormwatch</strong></h4>
<p>Still going.</p>
<h4><strong>Sprenspotting</strong></h4>
<p>Aside from Pattern, we only see some fearspren wriggling up around Shallan while Mraize tries various ways to induce her to reveal Tyn’s whereabouts. Useless, annoying, traitorous little beasties, some of these spren. Pattern, by contrast, is useful, entertaining, and eminently loyal, if occasionally startling.</p>
<h4><strong>Ars Arcanum</strong></h4>
<p>Lightweaving is very useful indeed, especially when you can look like part of the wall. <em>Very</em> handy for getting rid of someone following you, though you sure don’t want to run out of Stormlight in the middle of it. On consideration, I think the most chancy part of Lightweaving disguises is that you have to carry a small fortune on you all the time<em>—</em>even when you’re in a disguise that shouldn’t carry more than a pittance. But then, I guess that’s true for any Surgebinder; it would be chancy to run out of Stormlight when you’re a few hundred feet above the ground, too.</p>
<h4><strong>Ars Mechanica</strong></h4>
<p>This chapter only has one fabrial (that I noticed), and it’s one I’d dearly love to possess. It’s a little gizmo that gathers the smoke from the fireplace and just winds it up like thread on a spool. Sweet.</p>
<h4><strong>Haven’t We Met Somewhere Before?</strong></h4>
<p>Oh, I have been looking forward to this chapter for a long time. I’m going to tuck all the off-world references (objects included) into this one section, so anyone who wants to avoid spoilers can just skip over it and go read about the Heraldic Symbolism. <strong>MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD.</strong> You stand warned.</p>
<p>I don’t honestly know how many of these people are actual Worldhoppers, and I haven’t identified all of the objects, but I’ll list all of them, and speculate when I don’t know. Surprise.</p>
<p>The people: The Horneater guard, Mraize, the rat-toothed man, the creepy woman with the carapace mask, and four nondescript &#8220;other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Horneater I’m inclined to take at face value, given his way of speaking; he talks like Rock. Rat-tooth seems like he ought to be recognizable if we’d ever seen him before, but I don’t remember him, so I’ll take him for a Rosharan native. Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>Mraize<em>—</em>which appears to be a title rather than a name<em>—</em>is a confirmed Worldhopper, but I’ve seen no proof of his planet of origin. He might be Rosharan; he uses terms like “babsk” very readily. I’ve seen speculation that he’s Thaylen based on that alone, but given the lack of eyebrow mentioning I doubt it. He might be someone we’ve met elsewhere, though the only person I can think of that might fit his appearance is Clamps (from <em>Alloy of Law</em>), and he doesn’t really seem the type. In fact, the only similarities I can point to are that each is heavily scarred, and each is willing to kill anyone who proves to be inconvenient. Not much to bet the rent money on.</p>
<p>Iyatil, the creepy woman with the carapace mask, is certainly a world-hopper… but I don’t know who she is. She’s short, tan-skinned, darkeyed, and has an affinity for carapace, whatever that proves. It’s described as “red-orange” similar to the Parshendi “orange-red” – is she using actual Parshendi carapace? The way it’s described (“it looked like the skin had started to grow around the edges of the mask somehow”) almost makes me wonder if she <em>is</em> Parshendi, but of a form (or tribe) we’ve not yet seen. Perhaps, being a Worldhopper, she’s an ancient Parshendi who has been elsewhere and has returned? We do have this rather cryptic WoB:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, that&#8217;s kind of a hard thing to say. She has three planets she&#8217;s &#8220;from&#8221;. For example, she&#8217;s living now on Roshar, but then she&#8217;s from a different planet, but that&#8217;s not the planet that her people are from.</p></blockquote>
<p>So probably not a Parshendi, but she might share roots with them… or something… Oy.</p>
<p>The objects: Several enormous (un-infused) gemhearts; vaguely-recognizable shells; a tusk “probably from a whitespine;” an eye socket that looks like it might have belonged to a santhid; a vial of pale sand; a couple of thick hairpins; a lock of golden hair; the branch of a tree with writing on it; a silver knife; an odd flower preserved in solution; a chunk of delicate, flaky crystal. Quite the assortment, and most of them seem to be Invested<em>—</em>or at least capable of being Invested.</p>
<p>The gemhearts, to be that big, must come from an extraordinary species. Could these be the gemhearts of some of the Tai-na? That would be… kind of awful. Likewise, the (partial) santhid skull &#8211; though a little less awful because we already know that the occasional dead santhid has washed up on shore. What are the implications, though, of having a santhid skull in <em>this</em> collection?</p>
<p>The shells and the tusk just don’t give us enough to go on, though I wonder what would make a whitespine tusk sufficiently notable to be included. Are whitespines more significant than I thought, or is she wrong about the source? Skipping ahead a bit, I can’t yet identify the branch with writing on it, though I think I should. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>A vial of pale sand: this is absolutely Invested sand, from the planet Taldain (in the as-yet unpublished novel <em>White Sand</em>). Note that this is also the planet of origin for “Blunt” (of the Ishikk Interlude) and Khriss (the woman who knows more about the Cosmere than Hoid). We don’t know what the Shard there is, but the fact that the sand is pale means it is actively Invested.</p>
<p>A couple of thick hairpins: I can’t find WoB on this, but I’m reasonably confident these are actually Hemalurgic spikes. Ick. I wonder if they’re Invested – and if so, with what?</p>
<p>A lock of golden hair: This could be from several different locations; it’s been significant here on Roshar (the Iri have golden hair, and some consider it lucky), on Sel (royal individuals both in <em>Elantris</em> and in <em>The Emperor’s Soul</em>), and then on Nalthis there are the royal locks from <em>Warbreaker</em>. Could be anything!</p>
<p>A silver knife: Best guess, this is from Threnody (<em>Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell</em>). Silver is <em>extremely</em> important there, and a silver knife invaluable.</p>
<p>An odd flower preserved in some kind of solution: IMO, this is obviously the flower known as Tears of Edgli from Nalthis (<em>Warbreaker</em>), which are related to Endowment; they give the best dyes, thus being very helpful in Awakening.</p>
<p>That chunk of pale pink crystal: I think it’s from Aether of Night, and I hope I don’t get too much fetch for saying that. Another unpublished book, but in this case IIRC Brandon doesn’t intend to publish it; he may rework it later in a completely different form, or just borrow all the good bits to use elsewhere.</p>
<p>Maybe the branch-with-writing-on-it is from Yolen? It would make a certain amount of sense.</p>
<h4><strong>Heraldic Symbolism</strong></h4>
<p>This is an interesting pair: Palah and the Joker. Palah, associated with the role of Scholar and the attributes of Learned and Giving, patron of the Truthwatchers. Are the Ghostbloods aligned, or opposing? And the Joker… I can’t help connecting that masked face with the masked woman in the chapter. She’s a wild card if ever I saw one.</p>
<p>The chapter title couldn’t possibly be more obvious.</p>
<h4><strong>Words of Radiants</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>And thus were the disturbances in the Revv toparchy quieted, when, upon their ceasing to prosecute their civil dissensions, Nalan’Elin betook himself to finally accept the Skybreakers who had named him their master, when initially he had spurned their advances and, in his own interests, refused to countenance that which he deemed a pursuit of vanity and annoyance; this was the last of the Heralds to admit to such patronage.</p>
<p>—From Words of Radiance, chapter 5, page 17</p></blockquote>
<p>Nalan strikes me as an arrogant sort. I’m trying to figure out how someone who seems to be so haughty and egocentric ends up with the role of Judge. I’m also still trying to parse this moderately convoluted sentence.</p>
<h4><strong>Shipping Wars</strong></h4>
<p>Just one little note, at the very end of the chapter, when Shallan is considering the tasks ahead of her: the one involving Adolin is certainly the most appealing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when Kaladin returns to the practice grounds to take up Zahel’s offer of training. And it will finally be a <em>different</em> day.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 42: Mere Vapors</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Her suite in Sebarial’s manor<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Pattern, Shalash</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Shallan and Pattern discuss the intricacies of figurative speech, lies, truth, and illusion; Pattern spots a pattern and prevents a probable crash-and-burn for Shallan; spanreeds allow her to communicate with the Ghostbloods in Sebarial’s warcamp via an intermediary on the other side of the continent; Shallan practices deliberate Illusion drawing, and learns from Pattern that her Illusion will last as long as she holds Stormlight; a meeting is set for tonight; Shallan rifles Tyn’s belongings for clothing to outfit her illusory person, and climbs out the window.</em></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Quote of the Week:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The lock of hair hanging down over her shoulder was black. Shallan stared at it, then rose from her seat, eager and timid at the same time. She crossed to the washroom and stepped up to the mirror there, looking at a face transformed, one with tan skin and dark eyes. The face from her drawing, given color and life.</p>
<p>“It works<em>…</em>” she whispered. This was more than changing scuffs in her dress or making herself look older, as she’d done before. This was a complete transformation. “What can we do with this?”</p>
<p>“Whatever we imagine,” Pattern said from the wall nearby. “Or whatever you can imagine. I am not good with what is <em>not</em>. But I like it. I like the<em>…</em> taste<em>…</em> of it.” He seemed very pleased with himself at that comment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Semi-relevant personal anecdote: Some years ago, I had major jaw surgery. Needless to say, in the immediate aftermath, the lower half of my face swelled dramatically – but since I had a narrow face to start with, the result was not <em>terribly</em> disproportionate for a normal-sized (okay, chubby) face. It did not, however, look like <em>my</em> face. Under the lingering influence of anesthesia and painkillers, my first thought on seeing a mirror was, “They must have put me in someone else’s room, because the other person is there in the mirror.”  It only took ten or fifteen seconds for the logic to sort itself out, but that’s the impression that springs to mind when I think of what it must have been like for Shallan to see her reflection in this scene.</p>
<p><strong>Commentary:</strong>  For a chapter where the most action involves walking from the couch to the washroom, there’s a lot going on up in here. First of all, I love it when Pattern starts talking like a Cryptic, with all the lies and truths and how evidently the words mean something ever so slightly different to him than to us.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You say you are ‘on’ the stomach,” Pattern said. “But I know you do not mean this. Context allows me to infer what you truly mean. In a way, the very phrase is a lie.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a lie,” Shallan said, “if everyone understands and knows what it means.”</p>
<p>“Mm. Those are some of the best lies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Once again, we’re reminded that Pattern is very, very literal; figurative speech delights him even though he finds it hard to understand. (I think there should be some deeper meaning in this, but it’s lost on me at the moment.)</p>
<p>Fortunately for Shallan, he’s also very, very observant and the name she has given him is apt. Also fortunately for Shallan, her “instantaneous communication across half the world” is inconveniently delayed: while they’re waiting for the someone at the other end of Tyn’s spanreed to return, Pattern decodes the authentication cypher she needs to get access to Tyn’s connections. That was a close one, m’dear. However… it leaves a question hanging. Just before Pattern finds the pattern, there’s this:</p>
<blockquote><p>One oddity stood out to Shallan. The way Tyn spoke of this group wasn’t like that of a thief and one-off employers. Tyn spoke of “getting in good” and “moving up” within the Ghostbloods.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is the “oddity” merely that Tyn was not entirely consistent in the way she presented herself to Shallan versus her correspondent and/or the Ghostbloods? Or is this a hint about future developments?</p>
<p>RAFO. *sigh*</p>
<p>Shallan proceeds to do her very best imitation of Tyn’s attitude and manner toward the person at the other end of the spanreed, and ends up with a meeting scheduled in less than half an hour, if she can “get to Sebarial’s warcamp quickly.” If. Heh. Her disguise consists of a whole lot of strange-to-her clothing; it’s good she and Tyn were roughly of a size. One of Tyn’s white coats with a wide black belt, a buttoned shirt, boots (Kaladin’s?), and Bluth’s white hat to shade her face and disguise her fuzzy nose. Loose trousers, which feel a bit odd but at least she was used to seeing them… but I’m torn between snickers and sympathy over her reaction to that thin glove on her safehand. Poor girl. Even her Illusion blushes.</p>
<p>Summoning Jasnah’s lessons to support her, she finally collects all her needful bits-and-bobs and climbs out the window. Because all good adventures should start by climbing out the window.</p>
<p><strong>Stormwatch:</strong>  Energizer Day, evening. Thirty-seven days remaining in the countdown.</p>
<p><strong>Ars Arcanum:</strong>  Lightweaving! Lightweaving all over the where! This is nicely set up to parallel Kaladin’s efforts in the previous chapter, with two notable differences. Pattern seems to have a more thorough grasp of Lightweaving than Syl has of Windrunning. Best two guesses: 1) Pattern was not isolated from his kind by his bonding as Syl was; she rebelled and is the <em>only</em> bonded honorspren, while Pattern was clearly in communication with other Cryptics when we first saw them back in <em>TWoK</em>. 2) Pattern’s earlier learning time with Shallan, while interrupted for six years, has returned to him over the last few months, while Syl hasn’t had any previous experience and is still figuring things out for the first time. I’m not entirely sure that second option is as applicable to spren as it would be to humans, but it’s at least partly relevant. In any event, I guess it’s only fair that Shallan’s spren knows more than Kaladin’s, because he’s got friends to help him learn, and she’s flying solo. Or… no, it’s Kaladin that flies. Shallan… weaves alone? Doesn’t have the same ring to it, somehow.</p>
<p>Anyway. Like Kaladin, Shallan has done <em>some</em> Surgebinding before (that she remembers), but this is a new step. Always before, she was building on an existing framework, making little modifications here and there, enhancing this and disguising that. This time, she draws something <em>different</em>: dark eyes, dark hair, worn features, a scar. She keeps her body mostly the same, in terms of height and build, but no one could possibly see this Illusion as merely an older or more polished Shallan. <em>Everything</em> is different. And Pattern matter-of-factly says, “Sure, no worries. Your imagination is the limit. More coffee?” … or words to that effect.</p>
<p>Not that it was perfect—she forgot to finish the nose on her drawing, so now she has a fuzzy gap. (I’m not quite sure, though, why she can’t just go back to the drawing, add in the necessary line, and make it look un-fuzzy.) I’m relieved that she didn’t do a whole WoT-style “Mask of Mirrors” to change her clothing and everything, but had to go dig through Tyn’s working wardrobe to find stuff suitable to the persona she was weaving. Which is not to say that she couldn’t do a full-body-and-clothes Illusion some other time, of course, but it would be a bit much for a first effort. And that long-ago reference to Tyn’s annoying lessons in forgery now comes full circle, aiding Shallan in a way Tyn <em>certainly</em> didn’t intend!</p>
<p>Is this really the first time Shallan has made the connection between her Illusions and the Stormlight she holds? When she asks Pattern how long the Illusion will last, he tells her that it feeds on Light; she looks and realizes that she had apparently drained all the spheres in her safepouch during the meeting with the highprinces. While it does explain the changes noted by Sebarial during their carriage ride, because the Illusion faded as the spheres ran out, it makes me wonder: was she drawing Stormlight from those spheres involuntarily, or instinctively? And was she really completely unaware that she was doing so? (I guess I should go back and look, but… not now.)</p>
<p><strong>You Have to Break a Lot of Rockbuds:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Suddenly ravenous, Shallan sat down on the sofa, lifting the lid off the tray to find flatbread that had been baked with sweet paste in the center, along with dipping sauces.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did that sound like a danish to anyone besides me? Mmmm. Danish and coffee. Now I want breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>Heraldic Symbolism:</strong>   Shalash presides in solitary glory over this chapter, full as it is of Lightweaving. No further explanation seems necessary. The chapter title clearly comes from Jasnah’s remembered words at the end of the chapter:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Authority is not a real thing. It is <strong>mere vapors</strong>—an illusion. I can create that illusion… as can you.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Words of Radiants:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>But as for Ishi’Elin, his was the part most important at their inception; he readily understood the implications of Surges being granted to men, and caused organization to be thrust upon them; as having too great power, he let it be known that he would destroy each and every one, unless they agreed to be bound by precepts and laws.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">From <em>Words of Radiance</em>, chapter 2, page 4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we’re skipping from the ending of the Knights Radiant to their beginnings. This brings back a question discussed many chapters ago: whether the initial efforts at Surgebinding were strictly limited to exactly the combinations given to the Heralds, or whether that limit was one of the “precepts and laws” imposed on them by Ishar.</p>
<p>I can understand the argument that, since the spren were imitating what was given the Heralds, all they did was imitate exactly that. I’d really like to know if that’s certain, though. Does anyone have a WoB on the subject which I’ve been unable to find? Or is it merely a consensus among a group of fans who believe that it ought to be so? Because without a WoB, it seems far more probable to me that the spren experimented with granting humans access to whatever Surges they could influence – single Surges, various melds, one person with control over three, or four, or five Surges… That would also be a strong reason for Ishar to step in and say, “No. These ten combinations, and no others, always accompanied by Ideals that constrain the worst impulses of human nature.” The text says he “caused organization to be thrust upon them” – which <em>could</em> be as light as requiring each of the ten extant “families” of spren to abide by certain Ideals, or it <em>could</em> be as heavy as defining and imposing the system of ten Orders (with Ideals) and forbidding all others.</p>
<p>Please, if anyone has a clarifying WoB, speak now! I will be forever in your debt.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>With that, we’ll wrap this up until next week, when we meet… <em>The Ghostbloods</em>.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 41: Scars</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Kaladin<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>the chasms<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Spears, Jezrien, Vedeledev</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Kaladin finds the chasms homey; Bridge Seventeen begins chasm training; Syl challenges Kaladin to reconsider his purpose; he keeps his boots dry; Sigzil, Rock, and Lopen ask questions; Kaladin falls flat on his back; Syl is charmingly impertinent and gives Sigzil the fantods; the men discuss the cut-railing event; Kaladin performs a Basic Lashing!!!; he figures out his “purpose,” then falls off the wall—but only gets a soft clap from Rock because it didn’t include falling on his face; they return to discussing the railing, and Kaladin begins to see the truth; Renarin seeks to join Bridge Four; Kaladin knows a little too much about epilepsy for “field medicine” purposes; Moash drops a few more hints that all is not well with him; the lieutenants go out for the evening; Kaladin is far too dismissive of Sylphrena.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quote of the Week:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Lopen and Rock whooped below in excitement. Kaladin stared outward at the blue sky. “I have to know,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“Know?”</p>
<p>“You ask me why I protect Dalinar. I have to know if he really is what he seems, Syl. I have to know if one of them lives up to his reputation. That will tell me—”</p>
<p>“Tell you?” she asked, becoming the image of a full-size young woman standing on the wall before him. She was nearly as tall as he was, her dress fading to mist. “Tell you what?”</p>
<p>“If honor is dead,” Kaladin whispered.</p>
<p>“He is,” Syl said. “But he lives on in men. And in me.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And Kaladin goes on to promise that if Dalinar really is who he seems to be, he will get his Knights Radiant; Kaladin will reveal what he can do and trust him not to somehow take it away. Oh, Kaladin, Kaladin. It is not Dalinar who will fail you.</p>
<p><strong>Commentary:</strong> This chapter covers a lot of ground—including some vertical runs—and I know I can’t do justice to it all. But I’ll give it the old college try, eh?</p>
<p>Kaladin’s bridgeman training project enters phase two: having trained the sergeants, it’s now time to start training the units. Into the chasms with them! Heave, HO! But it works. I can’t prove it, but IMO it works because it somehow makes them see themselves as A Unit rather than a bunch of individual grunts. Right up front, Kaladin’s thoughts tell us that while some of them were purchased as slaves specifically for the bridge crews, plenty of them had been soldiers who broke some rule or other and got sentenced to bridge duty for it. Training, then, is not so much a matter of learning basic skills, but retraining the mind to be a responsible member of a cohesive unit. I do love the way they return to camp and find one of Rock’s assistants cooking a group stew.</p>
<p>Of course, the real news of the chapter is that Kaladin finally, consciously, deliberately performs a Basic Lashing (and only falls three times in the process). Did you notice that he sees Shadesmar here? He doesn’t enter it, only just gets a faint look at it, but that momentary connection with the Cognitive gives him the last little zip needed to make it work. He runs up the side of the chasm. Hey, good work if you can get it!</p>
<p>Sadly, he spoils his own moment with his suspicion, his mistrust, and his unconscionably arrogant and dismissive attitude toward Syl. Makes me want to reach in and smack him around a little bit.</p>
<p>Renarin: Please be gracious when arguing whether Renarin’s desire to join Bridge Four, and Kaladin’s decision to let him, is a good thing. Personally, I think it’s great on multiple levels. What interests me more, though, is this piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I will obey your commands,” Renarin said. “Treat me like a new recruit. When I’m here, I’m not a prince’s son, I’m not a lighteyes. I’m just another soldier. Please. I want to be part of it. When Adolin was young, my father made him serve in a spearman squad for two months.”</p>
<p>“He did?” Kaladin asked, genuinely surprised.</p>
<p>“Father said every officer should serve in the shoes of his men,” Renarin said. “I have Shards now. I’m going to be in war, but I’ve never felt what it’s like to really be a soldier. I think this is the closest I’ll be able to get. <em>Please</em>.”</p>
<p>Kaladin folded his arms, looking the youth over. Renarin looked anxious. Very anxious. He’d formed his hands to fists, though Kaladin could see no sign of the box Renarin often fiddled with when nervous. He’d begun breathing deeply, but had set his jaw, and kept his eyes forward.</p>
<p>Coming to see Kaladin, to ask this of him, <em>terrified</em> the young man for some reason. He’d done it anyway. Could one ask anything more of a recruit?</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot of juiciness right here, but the last part fascinates me. Why was Renarin so terrified of asking Kaladin if he could join Bridge Four? And what was the impetus that drove him to do so despite his fear? It’s these little glimpses of a sensitive soul and an amazing self-control that truly built my respect for Renarin in this book. I want so badly to know more.</p>
<p>For the first time in forever, Kaladin sets aside his anti-lighteyes fervor and considers this young man as an actual human being. Moash… well, Moash makes me wonder why I react so much more negatively to his prejudices than to Kaladin’s. I suppose a lot of it is simply that I’ve been in Kaladin’s head a lot, and as much as I get angry at him for his attitudes, at least I understand them. The other part is, I’ll admit, my own personal experience with <em>this</em> attitude: “He doesn’t act right, Kal. The way he talks, the way he looks at people. He’s strange.”</p>
<p>Of course, I have to admit that my attitude toward Moash is thoroughly affected by knowledge of later events, so I suppose I’m not being entirely fair to him. Too bad, I guess…</p>
<p><strong>Stormwatch:</strong> I’m just going to dub this the Energizer day, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Sprenspotting:</strong> Sylphrena executes all manner of activity in this chapter. My personal favorites are when she pokes Kaladin in the neck to get his attention, when she takes the form of a full size woman to confront Kaladin, and when she allows Sigzil to see her—and then makes her face look exactly like his. That’s my favorite. Heh. She also dances with a flamespren for some reason. Regarding other spren, though, there’s this:</p>
<blockquote><p>He passed piles of bones and wood, overgrown with moss. On one pile, rotspren and lifespren spun about one another, little motes of red and green glowing around the vines that sprouted incongruously from the mass of death.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I really, really wonder what this would look like in the Cognitive realm. <em>Really</em> wonder.</p>
<p><strong>All Creatures Shelled and Feathered:</strong> Kurls, crabs, tortoises, chasmfiends. Kurls apparently assign the job of protecting the eggs to the male of the species, and look like a cross between a crab and a tortoise—incidentally implying they have crabs and tortoises on Roshar. Just to prove it, Rock picks up a crab for a snack.</p>
<p>As for the chasmfiend… well, we don’t <em>see</em> it in this chapter, but there is unequivocal evidence that it has been through here very recently. <em>::shudder::</em> I assume this is the same chasmfiend that Kaladin and Shallan will encounter later?</p>
<p><strong>You Have to Break a Lot of Rockbuds:</strong> I renamed this category, just because. I don’t always notice food on the way by why I’m reading, but on Roshar, it seems like everything edible comes in a shell. Except chicken and bacon. Rock, of course, doesn’t bother <em>removing</em> the shell before he starts munching. Yum…</p>
<p><strong>Heraldic Symbolism:</strong> This week’s Heralds are obvious, I think: Jezrien reflects the Windrunning Kaladin finally achieves, along with the leading and protecting functions he maintains. Vedel, as she did in TWoK, almost always graces any chapter which references Kaladin’s early training with his father—in this case, the discussion of Renarin’s epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>Words of Radiants:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>This act of great villainy went beyond the impudence which had hitherto been ascribed to the orders; as the fighting was particularly intense at this time, many attributed this act to a sense of inherent betrayal; and after they withdrew, about two thousand made assault upon them, destroying much of the membership; but this was only nine of the ten, as one said they would not abandon their arms and flee, but instead entertained great subterfuge at the expense of the other nine.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">—From <em>Words of Radiance</em>, chapter 38, page 20</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buh. Here we are, doing the great villainy of Chapter 38 some more. Who was fighting whom? When? Was this scenario related to the scene Dalinar saw at Feverstone Keep? This thing is just going to keep nagging at me until it gets cleared up: <em>What caused the Recreance, and what was the sequence of events?</em></p>
<p>This quotation also opens up that can of worms labeled “The Order That Didn’t.” Didn’t what? Not sure, exactly, but didn’t something. Speculation abounds that one Order has been maintained continuously for the last umpty-thousand years, albeit in secret. Speculation has also identified several different Orders as that One Order, all with justifications that seem logical to the proponents of the theory. Me, I ain’t sayin’ nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>Just Sayin’:</strong> Okay, I’m totally sayin’ somethin’—just not about <em>that</em> subject. Lots of little idioms in this chapter: “Heralds send…;” “like a father kurl watches over his eggs;” “what storm brought them a….” They’re fairly straightforward and relatable, in general. I got a chuckle out of the guys going out to “visit a few taverns, play some rings, get something to drink”—sounds like “rings” might be the Rosharan equivalent of darts. My totally <em>favorite</em> one, of course, was the Lopen:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Gon, I haven’t been to Herdaz since I was a baby. There are as many Herdazians in Alethkar and Jah Keved these days as there are in our homeland. Flick my sparks, I’m practically an Alethi! Only not so tall and not so grouchy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Not sure what the relationship is, but in a few chapters there will be a Herdazian using a sparkflicker. What is it with Herdazians and flicking sparks?</p>
<p>Also, spark is one of <em>those</em> words—it ceases to sound like a real word when you use it too many times in a row. Just sayin’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when Shallan begins her infiltration projects. File under “things that will definitely go well.”</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 40: Palona</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Point of View:</strong> Shallan<br />
<strong>Setting: </strong>Sebarial’s warcamp<br />
<strong>Symbology: </strong>Pattern, Kalak, Vedel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>IN WHICH</em></strong><em> Shallan proceeds with Sebarial to his warcamp, complete with promised badinage; she observes that his warcamp is more like a well-planned city; Jasnah’s notes prove <span style="text-decoration: line-through">insightful</span> completely inadequate and outdated; Sebarial has built a thriving economy out here in nowhere; Palona greets them at the manor with more wit and humor; Sebarial gives a breezy account of Shallan’s presence, and Shallan provides an only slightly more complete one; Palona welcomes her anyway; Shallan blanks out again; arrangements are made for appropriate servants, wages, and so on; Shallan falls asleep in a bed made apparently of air and wishes.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quote of the Week:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“… I have the most complete force of tailors, artisans, and cooks in the camps. Already, I’ve set up twelve manufactories—textiles, shoes, ceramics, several mills. I control the glassblowers as well.”</p>
<p>Shallan turned back toward him. That pride in his voice didn’t <em>at all</em> match what Jasnah had written of the man. Of course, most of her notes and knowledge of the highprinces came from infrequent visits to the Shattered Plains, and none had been recent.</p>
<p>“From what I’ve heard,” Shallan said, “your forces are among the least successful in the war against the Parshendi.”</p>
<p>Sebarial got a twinkle in his eyes. “The others hunt quick income from gemhearts, but what will they spend their money on?&#8230;”</p></blockquote>
<p>I like Sebarial. <em>Not</em> your typical Alethi lighteyes. He has pride in his accomplishments, and they’re genuinely <em>his</em> accomplishments. He hires capable people, listens to their input, decides what to implement, and lets them do their job (well, except for the cook), all the while directing the activity toward his own goals. He achieves a unique power by providing what everyone else needs but does not value, while the other highprinces are pursuing things they value but don’t need.</p>
<p><strong>Commentary: </strong>I often start the reread process by going through a chapter, highlighting items I want to talk about and sections that I think might make a good QOTW. That… didn’t work very well this time; I found myself highlighting whole pages, one after the other. Oops.</p>
<p>The thing is, I really like Sebarial, and when Palona enters the scene, it just gets better. One tidbit I relished was the description of Sebarial’s banner:</p>
<blockquote><p>It bore the glyphs <em>sebes</em> and <em>laial</em> stylized into a <strong>skyeel</strong>, deep gold on a black field</p></blockquote>
<p>combined, a page or so later with Shallan’s reaction to learning of his undertakings:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You <strong>sly eel</strong>,” Shallan said. “While the others fight a war, you’ve been building an economy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Heh. How fitting. Seriously, though, his description of war – especially this war—is too true: it’s a lot of work, soldiers die, you have to pay their families, and it’s useless all around. So he pays the fines to skip most of his assigned plateau runs, and puts his resources to work positioning himself to gain most of the actual <em>profit</em> from the gemhearts. At that, though, he’s got one of the best-trained armies on the Plains, because whatever he’s doing, he hires the best people to do the job and lets them do it.</p>
<p>This chapter sets up an excellent working relationship between Sebarial, Shallan, and Palona. The trouble is, I don’t remember it developing very much throughout the book. Hopefully, that’s just my mind flaking out on me, because it would be a crying shame to have such a lovely state of affairs and then not use it.</p>
<p>It was unexpectedly kind of Sebarial to point out that, as much as he enjoys her not-traditional-court-manners, she does need to be careful where she aims her wit. She’s playing for much higher stakes now than she ever has before, and retribution for insult here would not only be swift, it might well doom the world. No pressure, though, girl.</p>
<p>I keep wanting to quote big chunks of this chapter. So much delight, especially when they meet Palona. She’s <em>awesome</em>. I’ll give in just a little to my quote-frenzy, and insert my very favorite bit of the whole chapter:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Bah!” Sebarial said. “Woman, you make me the most henpecked man in all of Alethkar—”</p>
<p>“We aren’t <em>in</em> Alethkar.”</p>
<p>“—and I’m not even storming married!”</p>
<p>“I’m not marrying you, so stop asking,” Palona said, folding her arms, looking Shallan up and down speculatively. “She’s far too young for you.”</p>
<p>Sebarial grinned. “I used that line already. On Ruthar. It was delightful—he sputtered so much, you could have mistaken him for a storm.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll&#8230; just shut up and let you enjoy that in all its scrumptiousness.</p>
<p>Anyway, Palona not only assures Shallan that she will get the stipend implied, she also—without any sentimental gloop—simply, completely, and matter-of-factly makes her welcome. Shallan gets a little excited about running water, which she saw for the first time in Kharbranth (and which tells us a little about the state of development in rural Jah Keved); Palona’s response makes me smile every time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left">“Welcome to civilization. I trust you left your club and loincloth at the door.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Civilization. On the Shattered Plains. Heh.</p>
<p><strong>Stormwatch:</strong> Yup. Same day as Chapters 35-38. Still going…</p>
<p><strong>All Creatures Shelled and Feathered:</strong> Hogs. Just a reminder, in case you were worried: yes, Roshar <em>does</em> have bacon. And Sebarial farms the hogs to provide real, un-Soulcast bacon to the armies.</p>
<p>I wonder if you can Soulcast bacon? Betcha can’t.</p>
<p>Okay, so we haven’t actually <em>seen</em> bacon on Roshar, but if they haven’t figured it out yet, I’m very disappointed in them. In any case, we have not only hog farms, but lavis and tallew, which an enterprising highprince with the right assortment of engineers and farmers can make totally viable even out here on the somewhat desolate edge of the Shattered Plains.</p>
<p><strong>Heraldic Symbolism:</strong> This one was fairly straightforward. I think. Kalak is logical in his role as Maker, which suits Sebarial’s activities to a T. I find humor in noticing that Kalak’s traditional “body focus,” the nails, are also the key for Shallan to identify Palona’s ethnic background – Herdazian, with their “rocklike cast” to the fingernails. (I think it would be totally awesome and hilarious if Sebarial turns out to be a Willshaper…) Vedeledev may not be quite so obvious, but I do think Palona plays a role as Healer for Shallan; it’s also hinted that perhaps Sebarial played a healing – or at least rescuing – role for Palona herself.</p>
<p><strong>Words of Radiants:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>That they responded immediately and with great consternation is undeniable, as these were primary among those who would forswear and abandon their oaths. The term Recreance was not then applied, but has since become a popular title by which this event is named. —From Words of Radiance, chapter 38, page 6</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This comes in the in-world book (with the possibility of a few intervening sentences) immediately after the epigraph of <em>our</em> Chapter 38, with its discovery of “some wicked thing of eminence.”</p>
<p>Frustratingly, it leaves open at least two possibilities: that they abandoned their oaths due to some perceived betrayal by the spren, or due to some perceived betrayal within the organization of the Knights Radiant.</p>
<p>The former seems more logical to me, since their actions severed them from their spren bonds, leaving their spren dead in sword-form forever. My current best guesses on this would be: discovery of a bonded spren (and Knight) turning to Odium; learning of the Odium-spren bonds of the Parshendi; or a spren posing as “normal” which deceived, bonded, and twisted a human. I still can’t help thinking about the Unmade in this context, but we have some strong indications that the Unmade have been around far longer than this.</p>
<p>It’s possible, however, that the Knights Radiant didn’t realize the effect that abandoning their oaths would have on the spren, and their action was intended to be a protest against something within the <em>Radiants</em> rather than destructive of their spren. I have a hard time imagining what could happen to make these fully-bonded Knights, who presumably knew their spren very well, choose to deliberately lock those spren into sword forms and a sort of living death.</p>
<p>Well, presumably we’ll learn more eventually, and in the meantime we can speculate all we want.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping Wars:</strong> This ship needs no help at all, but let me just say once again how much I love Sebarial and Palona. They’re priceless. (For everything else, there’s MasterCard… and he’ll take <em>any</em> form of payment.)</p>
<p><strong>Just Sayin’:</strong> The only one that caught my eye this time was “Winds know…” At that, I almost missed it because of the context:</p>
<blockquote><p>Palona smiled. “Winds know, you’re not the first stray he’s brought home. Some of us even end up staying.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aww. I want to know <em>that</em> story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There. That ought to keep us busy until next week, when Kaladin returns to the chasms, this time to train in earnest.</p>
